It was originally designed for the purpose\nof writing W3C specifications, but has since grown to be able to support other outputs as\nwell.\n\n## Getting started\n\nIf you are just interested in writing a spec, you can grab the [starter spec](examples/starter.html).\n\nWe have extensive documentation on [how to use ReSpec](https://github.com/w3c/respec/wiki) in our wiki, including:  \n\n  * [User's guide](https://github.com/w3c/respec/wiki/ReSpec-Editor's-Guide)\n  * [WebIDL guide](https://github.com/w3c/respec/wiki/WebIDL-Guide)\n\n**You don't need to check-out or fork this repository.**\n\nIf you are new to spec writing, we strongly encourage you to read:\n\n  * [API Design Principles](https://w3ctag.github.io/design-principles/)\n  * [Writing Promise-Using Specifications](https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/promises-guide)\n  * [Privacy and Security Self-Review Questionnaire](https://w3ctag.github.io/security-questionnaire/)\n\n## Getting help\n\nIf you experience issues, please email [spec-prod@w3.org](mailto:spec-prod@w3.org) or\nif you think something is broken, [file a bug](https://github.com/w3c/respec/issues).\n\n**Please note:** ReSpec is not endorsed by W3C and nobody should expect the W3C Webmaster to provide advice on\nproblems encountered with ReSpec, or on why it may be failing to produce pubrules-compliant\ncontent.\n\n## Bibliographical references\n\nBibliographical references have been moved out of ReSpec. You want to use\n[specref.org](http://www.specref.org/).\n\n## Want to see complete documentation?\n\n[Documentation for ReSpec](https://github.com/w3c/respec/wiki) is available in our wiki.\n\n## Contribute\n\nPlease see our [developer guide](https://github.com/w3c/respec/wiki/Developers-Guide). \n\nPlease note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Please make branch names informative - by including the issue or bug number for example.\n\nEditorial changes that improve the readability of the specification or correct spelling or grammatical mistakes are welcome.\n\nAll pull requests must have been reviewed by one or more participants of the working groups. Once the pull request gets enough support, it can be merged.\n\n### Test driven\n\nALL normative spec changes are generally expected to have a corresponding pull request in [web-platforms-tests][WPT], either in the form of new tests or modifications to existing tests, or must include the rationale for why test updates are not required for the proposed update.\n\nTypically, both pull requests (spec updates and tests) will be merged at the same time. If a pull\nrequest for the specification is approved but the other needs more work, add the '[needs tests](https://w3c.github.io/spec-labels.html)'\nlabel or, in web-platform-tests, the '[status:needs-spec-decision](https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=label%3Astatus%3Aneeds-spec-decision%20)' label. Note that a test change that\ncontradicts the specification should not be merged before the corresponding specification change.\n\nIf testing is not practical due to [web-platforms-tests][WPT] limitations, please explain why and if appropriate [file an issue](https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/issues/new) with the '[type:untestable](https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=label%3Atype%3Auntestable%20)' label to follow up later.\n\nSee also the [web-platform-tests documentation][WPT-intro].\n\n## Patent Policy and Licensing\n\nContributions to the Web Performance repositories are intended to become part of Recommendation-track\ndocuments governed by the\n[W3C Patent Policy](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy-20040205/) and\n[Software and Document License](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/copyright-software).

It answers these questions:\n\n* [What’s the goal of web-spec testing]?\n\n* [How does testing relate to W3C “CR exit criteria”]?\n\n* [How to decide what tests are needed for a spec]?\n\n* [How to produce the tests needed for a spec]?\n\n## What’s the goal of web-spec testing?\n\nThe goal of web-spec testing is to help achieve **interoperability** among different implementations of a web spec.\n\nThe means for providing evidence to evaluate interoperability for a spec, and the means to *document*\ninteroperability for a spec—or lack of interoperability—is to write test cases for all requirements in the spec.\n\nSo *web-spec testing* means **writing tests for requirements in web specs, and running those tests**.\n\n### web-platform-tests\n\n[web-platform-tests](https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests) is a repository of tests for dozens of specs—the\nmajority being for features of the [web runtime].\n\n[web-platform-tests](https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests) also provides test infrastructure that includes test\nharnesses and a self-hosted web server which enables you to write custom backend code (in Python) to control server\nbehavior for tests—for example, for tests that expect particular HTTP headers, or that otherwise expect certain types\nof server responses, and so on.\n\nW3C working groups maintain their tests in the [web-platform-tests] (https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests) repo,\nusing the infrastructure provided.\n\n## How does testing relate to W3C “CR exit criteria”?\n\nIn order to publish a Candidate Recommendation of a spec at the W3C, working groups are required to [“document how\nadequate implementation experience will be demonstrated”] for the spec.\n\n[“document how adequate implementation experience will be demonstrated”]:\nhttps://www.w3.org/2017/Process-20170301/#candidate-rec\n\nW3C working groups deal with that requirement by including in the Status section of the spec a statement about the\nspecific **CR exit criteria** the spec must meet to be able to exit from CR—and the spec exits from CR when the\nworking group demonstrates that the spec has met the CR exit criteria the group has set for it.\n\nW3C working groups can choose to set whatever CR exit criteria they want for a spec—as long at it demonstrates\nadequate implementation experience—but in practice, working groups commonly choose to define the exit criteria for a\nspec as being that there are least **two interoperable implementations of each feature in the spec**.\n\nSo a common way for a W3C group to handle the requirement to [“document how adequate implementation experience will be\ndemonstrated”] is to include a statement like the following in the Status section of a spec:\n\n> This Candidate Recommendation will have met its exit criteria when there are at least two interoperable\n> implementations of each feature in the spec, documented in an implementation report.\n\nNo implementation report needs to exist at the time a CR version of a spec is published. Groups can use the CR phase\nto develop the implementation report.\n\nAnd the way that groups develop implementation reports to document they’ve met their CR exit criteria is by first\n**writing tests and running those tests against multiple implementations**, then putting the results into the report.\n\n## How to decide what tests are needed for a spec?\n\nThe process of testing a spec begins by ensuring the spec contains testable requirements. For advice on writing those\nkinds of requirements into a spec, a number of how-to guides are available:\n\n* [QA Framework: Specification Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/qaframe-spec/)\n* [A Method for Writing Testable Conformance Requirements](https://www.w3.org/TR/test-methodology/)\n* [Writing specifications: Kinds of statements](https://ln.hixie.ch/?start=1140242962&count=1)\n\nTesting the requirements in a spec means testing the available implementations for the spec—which is a means to\ndocument the [implementation experience] for the spec, based on the **features** in the spec.\n\n> Implementation experience is required to show that a specification is sufficiently clear, complete, and relevant to\n> market needs, to ensure that independent interoperable implementations of each feature of the specification will be\n> realized\n\n[implementation experience]:\nhttps://www.w3.org/2017/Process-20170301/#implementation-experience\n\nSo the task of evaluating what tests are needed for a particular spec begins by determining what features a spec\nsupplies. Features for the [web runtime] are defined using these mechanisms:\n\n* [RFC 2119 keywords]\n* [WebIDL blocks]\n* [ABNF]\n* [HTTP header definitions]\n* [Algorithms]\n* [Elements, attributes, and attribute-value definitions]\n* [CSS property definitions]\n\nOther web features can be defined using these mechanisms:\n\n* [Vocabulary definitions]\n\nThe following sections provide specific guidelines on how to look at a spec to determine which of the above mechanisms\nit uses, and so what features from the spec need to be tested.\n\n### RFC 2119 keywords\n\n[RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119) defines keywords such as “must” and “must not” to be used in specs to\ndefine requirements for implementations. All W3C specs, regardless of the particular constructs they employ to define\nfeatures, have at least some requirements specified using RFC 2119 keywords.\n\nSo wherever a spec uses RFC 2119 keywords, the spec is defining mandatory behavior of a feature that implementations\nare required to follow; and thus, evaluating implementations of the spec necessitates writing tests for each\nstatement that uses an RFC 2119 keyword.\n\nIf the implementations for which a spec defines features are browser engines and the RFC 2119 keywords in the spec\ndefine requirements observable from JavaScript code running in a browser, then the [web-platform-tests] infrastructure\nhas an extensive set of methods that can be used to write tests for the requirements.\n\n### WebIDL blocks\n\nW3C specs that define programming interfaces employ [WebIDL](https://heycam.github.io/webidl/) as a formalism: Specs\ncontain WebIDL “blocks” that use the WebIDL formalism to specify the “API shape” for an interface, including how\ninstances of the interface are instantiated/constructed, and the methods and properties that prototypes and instances\nof the interface provide.\n\nSo the features such specs provide include capabilities and information exposed by methods and properties the\ninterfaces supply—and thus if is a spec contains WebIDL blocks, the tests necessary to evaluate implementations need\nto include tests of conformance to the requirements formally defined in all the WebIDL blocks in the spec.\n\nThe [web-platform-tests] infrastructure provides a specific test harness, [idlharness.js], for writing WebIDL tests.\n\n[idlharness.js]:\nhttp://testthewebforward.org/docs/testharness-idlharness.html\n\n### ABNF\n\n[to come]\n\n### HTTP header definitions\n\n[to come]\n\n### Algorithms\n\nSpecs don’t just use formalisms such as [WebIDL blocks] or [ABNF] to specify functional behavior or syntax, nor do\nspecs always define all other requirements using statements with explicit [RFC 2119 keywords]. Many requirements are\nalso often found in steps within multi-step algorithms given for implementations to follow.\n\nWhile some steps in some algorithms might have [RFC 2119 keywords], many do not. Instead the algorithms might be\npreceded by a statement saying something like, *“Conforming implementations must follow this algorithm:”*—or the\nalgorithms might even be preceded with a statement just saying something like, *“Run these steps:”*.\n\nSo each algorithm in a spec must be closely examined to identify the exact behavior of the resulting feature the\nalgorithm is part of—and thus, evaluating implementations of the spec necessitates writing tests which cause each\nalgorithm in the spec to be exercised, and that then evaluate any observable results of each step of each algorithm.\n\nIf the implementations for which a spec defines features are browser engines and the algorithms in the spec define\nresults that are observable from JavaScript code running in a browser, then the [web-platform-tests] infrastructure\nhas an extensive set of methods that can be used to write tests for the features covered by the algorithms.\n\n### Element, attribute, and attribute-value definitions\n\n[to come]\n\n### CSS property definitions\n[to be contributed by somebody who’s familiar with writing CSS tests/specs; of course should mention reftests]\n\n### Vocabulary definitions\n[to be contributed by somebody who’s familiar with writing specs and tests for vocabularies]\n\n## How should my group go about producing tests for meeting CR exit criteria?\n\nThis section provides details about putting logistics into place for producing tests. \n\n### Test facilitator\n\nFor each spec, assign a person to be the “test facilitator” or “test czar” for that spec, and give that person the authority to make decisions, and the responsibility for ensuring the necessary tests are developed.\n\n### Test as you commit\n\nAll normative spec changes are generally expected to have a corresponding pull request in [web-platform-tests](https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests), either in the form of new tests or modifications to existing tests, or must include the rationale for why test updates are not required for the proposed update.\n\nTypically, both pull requests (spec updates and tests) will be merged at the same time. If a pull request for the specification is approved but the other needs more work, add the '[needs tests](https://w3c.github.io/spec-labels.html)' label or, in web-platform-tests, the '[status:needs-spec-decision](https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=label%3Astatus%3Aneeds-spec-decision%20)' label. Note that a test change that contradicts the specification should not be merged before the corresponding specification change.\n\nIf testing is not practical due to web-platforms-tests limitations, please explain why and if appropriate file an issue with the '[type:untestable](https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=label%3Atype%3Auntestable%20)' label to follow up later.\n\n[What’s the goal of web-spec testing]:\n#what-is-the-goal-of-web-spec-testing\n\n[How does testing relate to W3C “CR exit criteria”]:\n#how-does-testing-relate-to-w3c-cr-exit-criteria\n\n[How to decide what tests are needed for a spec]:\n#how-to-decide-what-tests-are-needed-for-a-spec\n\n[How to produce the tests needed for a spec]:\n#how-to-produce-the-tests-needed-for-a-spec\n\n[web-platform-tests]:\n#web-platform-tests\n\n[RFC 2119 keywords]:\n#rfc-2119-keywords\n\n[WebIDL blocks]:\n#webidl-blocks\n\n[ABNF]:\n#abnf\n\n[Algorithms]:\n#algorithms\n\n[HTTP header definitions]:\n#http-header-definitions\n\n[Elements, attributes, and attribute-value definitions]:\n#elements-attributes-and-attribute-value-definitions\n\n[CSS property definitions]:\n#css-property-definitions\n\n[Vocabulary definitions]:\n#vocabulary-definitions\n\n## Other resources\n\n* [QA Framework: Specification Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/qaframe-spec/)\n* [A Method for Writing Testable Conformance Requirements](https://www.w3.org/TR/test-methodology/)\n* [Writing specifications: Kinds of statements](https://ln.hixie.ch/?start=1140242962&count=1)\n\n<!-- -*- fill-column: 118 -*- vim: set textwidth=118 : -->\n"

If\nyou don't know what that is, then you probably don't need it. It is meant to be used\nboth in Node and in the browser (the parser likely works in other JS environments, but\nnot the test suite).\n\n## Installation\n\nJust the usual. For Node:\n\n```Bash\nnpm install webidl2\n```\n\nIn the browser:\n\n```HTML\n<script src='webidl2.js'></script>\n```\n\n## Documentation\n\nWebIDL2 provides two functions: `parse` and `write`.\n\n* `parse`: Converts a WebIDL string into a syntax tree.\n* `write`: Converts a syntax tree into a WebIDL string. Useful for programmatic code\n  modification.\n\nIn Node, that happens with:\n\n```JS\nvar WebIDL2 = require(\"webidl2\");\nvar tree = WebIDL2.parse(\"string of WebIDL\");\nvar text = WebIDL2.write(tree);\n```\n\nIn the browser:\n```HTML\n<script src='webidl2.js'></script>\n<script>\n  var tree = WebIDL2.parse(\"string of WebIDL\");\n</script>\n\n<script src='writer.js'></script>\n<script>\n  var text = WebIDL2Writer.write(tree);\n</script>\n```\n\n`write()` optionally takes a \"templates\" object, whose properties are functions that process input in different ways (depending on what is needed for output). Every property is optional. Each property is documented below:\n\n```js\nvar result = WebIDL2.write(tree, {\n  templates: {\n    /**\n     * A function that receives syntax strings plus anything the templates returned.\n     * The items are guaranteed to be ordered.\n     * The returned value may be again passed to any template functions,\n     * or it may also be the final return value of `write()`.\n     * @param {any[]} items\n     */\n    wrap: items => items.join(\"\"),\n    /**\n     * @param {string} t A trivia string, which includes whitespaces and comments.\n     */\n    trivia: t => t,\n    /**\n     * The identifier for a container type. For example, the `Foo` part of `interface Foo {};`.\n     * @param {string} escaped The escaped raw name of the definition.\n     * @param data The definition with the name\n     * @param parent The parent of the definition, undefined if absent\n     */\n    name: (escaped, { data, parent }) => escaped,\n    /**\n     * Called for each type referece, e.g. `Window`, `Promise`, or `unsigned long`.\n     * @param escaped The referenced name. Typically string, but may also be the return\n     *            value of `wrap()` if the name contains whitespace.\n     * @param unescaped Unescaped reference.\n     */\n    reference: (escaped, unescaped) => escaped,\n    /**\n     * Called only once for each types, e.g. `Document`, `Promise<DOMString>`, or `sequence<long>`.\n     * @param type The `wrap()`ed result of references and syntatic bracket strings.\n     */\n    type: type => type,\n    /**\n     * Called for each value literals, e.g. `\"string\"` or `3.12`.\n     * @param {string} lit The raw literal string.\n     */\n    valueLiteral: lit => lit,\n    /**\n     * Receives the return value of `reference()`. String if it's absent.\n     */\n    inheritance: inh => inh,\n    /**\n     * Called for each IDL type definition, e.g. an interface, an operation, or a typedef.\n     * @param content The wrapped value of everything the definition contains.\n     * @param data The original definition object\n     * @param parent The parent of the definition, undefined if absent\n     */\n    definition: (content, { data, parent }) => content,\n    /**\n     * Called for each extended attribute annotation.\n     * @param content The wrapped value of everything the annotation contains.\n     */\n    extendedAttribute: content => contents.join(\"\"),\n    /**\n     * The `Foo` part of `[Foo=Whatever]`.\n     * @param ref The name of the referenced extended attribute name.\n     */\n    extendedAttributeReference: ref => ref\n  }\n});\n```\n\n\"Wrapped value\" here will all be raw strings when the `wrap()` callback is absent.\n\n### Errors\n\nWhen there is a syntax error in the WebIDL, it throws an exception object with the following\nproperties:\n\n* `message`: the error message\n* `line`: the line at which the error occurred.\n* `input`: a short peek at the text at the point where the error happened\n* `tokens`: the five tokens at the point of error, as understood by the tokeniser\n  (this is the same content as `input`, but seen from the tokeniser's point of view)\n\nThe exception also has a `toString()` method that hopefully should produce a decent\nerror message.\n\n### AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)\n\nThe `parse()` method returns a tree object representing the parse tree of the IDL.\nComment and white space are not represented in the AST.\n\nThe root of this object is always an array of definitions (where definitions are\nany of interfaces, dictionaries, callbacks, etc. — anything that can occur at the root\nof the IDL).\n\n### IDL Type\n\nThis structure is used in many other places (operation return types, argument types, etc.).\nIt captures a WebIDL type with a number of options. Types look like this and are typically\nattached to a field called `idlType`:\n\n```JS\n{\n  \"type\": \"attribute-type\",\n  \"generic\": null,\n  \"idlType\": \"unsigned short\",\n  \"nullable\": null,\n  \"union\": false,\n  \"baseName\": \"short\",\n  \"prefix\": {\n    \"value\": \"unsigned\",\n    \"trivia\": \" \"\n  },\n  \"postfix\": null,\n  \"separator\": null,\n  \"trivia\": {\n    \"base\": \" \"\n  },\n  \"extAttrs\": {\n    \"trivia\": {\n      \"open\": \"\\n\",\n      \"close\": \"\"\n    },\n    \"items\": [...]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWhere the fields are as follows:\n\n* `type`: String indicating where this type is used. Can be `null` if not applicable.\n* `generic`: An object with the following fields if the type is generic:\n  * `value`: String indicating the generic type (e.g. \"Promise\", \"sequence\").\n  * `trivia`: Whitespaces or comments preceding genenic type name token.\n* `idlType`: String indicating the type name, or array of subtypes if the type is\n  generic or a union.\n* `baseName`: String indicating the base type name, e.g. \"float\" for \"unrestricted\n  float\".\n* `prefix`: An object with the following fields if a prefix exists:\n  * `value`: String indicating the prefix name (\"unsigned\" or \"unrestricted\").\n  * `trivia`: Whitespaces or comments preceding prefix token.\n* `postfix`: An object with the following fields if a postfix exists:\n  * `value`: String indicating the prefix name, currently only for \"unsigned long long\".\n  * `trivia`: Whitespaces or comments preceding postfix token.\n* `separator`: An object with the following fields if a separator follows:\n  * `value`: String indicating the separator token value, e.g. \",\" or \"or\".\n  * `trivia`: Whitespaces or comments preceding separator token.\n* `nullable`: An object with a string type field `trivia` if the type is nullable.\n* `union`: Boolean indicating whether this is a union type or not.\n* `extAttrs`: An [extended attributes](#extended-attributes) container.\n\n### Trivia\n\nStructures often have `trivia` field that represents whitespaces and comments before tokens. It gives a string if the syntatic component is made of a single token or an object with multiple string type fields.\n\nA trivia object looks like the following example:\n\n```JS\n{\n  \"base\": \"\\n\",\n  \"name\": \" \",\n  \"...\": \"...\"\n}\n```\n\nFrequently, `base` is for type keywords, `name` is for identifiers, `open`/`close` are for brackets, and `termination` for semicolons.\n\n### Interface\n\nInterfaces look like this:\n\n```JS\n{\n  \"type\": \"interface\",\n  \"name\": \"Animal\",\n  \"partial\": null,\n  \"members\": [...],\n  \"trivia\": {\n    \"base\": \"\",\n    \"name\": \" \",\n    \"open\": \" \",\n    \"close\": \"\\n\",\n    \"termination\": \"\"\n  },\n  \"inheritance\": null,\n  \"extAttrs\": [...]\n}, {\n  \"type\": \"interface\",\n  \"name\": \"Human\",\n  \"partial\": null,\n  \"members\": [...],\n  \"trivia\": {\n    \"base\": \"\\n\\n\",\n    \"name\": \" \",\n    \"open\": \" \",\n    \"close\": \"\\n\",\n    \"termination\": \"\"\n  },\n  \"inheritance\": {\n    \"name\": \"Animal\",\n    \"trivia\": {\n      \"colon\": \" \",\n      \"name\": \" \"\n    }\n  },\n  \"extAttrs\": {\n    \"trivia\": {\n      \"open\": \"\\n\\n\",\n      \"close\": \"\"\n    },\n    \"items\": [...]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe fields are as follows:\n\n* `type`: Always \"interface\".\n* `name`: The name of the interface.\n* `partial`: If a partial interface, an object with a string type field `trivia`. Otherwise, `null`.\n* `members`: An array of interface members (attributes, operations, etc.). Empty if there are none.\n* `trivia`: A trivia object.\n* `inheritance`: An object giving the name of an interface this one inherits from, `null` otherwise.\n* `extAttrs`: An [extended attributes](#extended-attributes) container.\n\n### Interface mixins\n\nInterfaces mixins look like this:\n\n```JS\n{\n  \"type\": \"interface mixin\",\n  \"name\": \"Animal\",\n  \"partial\": null,\n  \"members\": [...],\n  \"trivia\": {\n    \"base\": \"\",\n    \"mixin\": \" \",\n    \"name\": \" \",\n    \"open\": \" \",\n    \"close\": \"\\n\",\n    \"termination\": \"\"\n  },\n  \"extAttrs\": [...]\n}, {\n  \"type\": \"interface mixin\",\n  \"name\": \"Human\",\n  \"partial\": null,\n  \"members\": [...],\n  \"trivia\": {\n    \"base\": \"\",\n    \"mixin\": \" \",\n    \"name\": \" \",\n    \"open\": \" \",\n    \"close\": \"\\n\",\n    \"termination\": \"\"\n  },\n  \"extAttrs\": {\n    \"trivia\": {\n      \"open\": \"\\n\\n\",\n      \"close\": \"\"\n    },\n    \"items\": [...]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe fields are as follows:\n\n* `type`: Always \"interface mixin\".\n* `name`: The name of the interface mixin.\n* `partial`: If a partial interface mixin, an object with a string type field `trivia`. Otherwise, `null`.\n* `members`: An array of interface members (attributes, operations, etc.). Empty if there are none.\n* `trivia`: A trivia object.\n* `extAttrs`: An [extended attributes](#extended-attributes) container.\n\n### Namespace\n\nNamespaces look like this:\n\n```JS\n{\n  \"type\": \"namespace\",\n  \"name\": \"console\",\n  \"partial\": null,\n  \"members\": [...],\n  \"trivia\": {\n    \"base\": \"\",\n    \"name\": \" \",\n    \"open\": \" \",\n    \"close\": \"\\n\",\n    \"termination\": \"\"\n  },\n  \"extAttrs\": {\n    \"trivia\": {\n      \"open\": \"\\n\\n\",\n      \"close\": \"\"\n    },\n    \"items\": [...]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe fields are as follows:\n\n* `type`: Always \"namespace\".\n* `name`: The name of the namespace.\n* `partial`: If a partial namespace, an object with a string type field `trivia`. Otherwise, `null`.\n* `members`: An array of namespace members (attributes and operations). Empty if there are none.\n* `trivia`: A trivia object.\n* `extAttrs`: An [extended attributes](#extended-attributes) container.\n\n### Callback Interfaces\n\nThese are captured by the same structure as [Interfaces](#interface) except that\ntheir `type` field is \"callback interface\".

Normally, running `npm test` in the root directory\nshould be enough once you're set up.\n\n### Browser tests\n\nIn order to test in the browser, get inside `test/web` and run `make-web-tests.js`. This\nwill generate a `browser-tests.html` file that you can open in a browser. As of this\nwriting tests pass in the latest Firefox, Chrome, Opera, and Safari. Testing on IE\nand older versions will happen progressively.\n",

For implementers and developers who seek a more stable version, [Service Workers 1](https://w3c.github.io/ServiceWorker/v1/) is a right document with which the contributors only focus on fixing bugs and resolving compatibility issues.\n\nSpec development happens via [issues in this repository](https://github.com/w3c/ServiceWorker/issues). For general discussion, please use the [public-webapps@w3.org mailing list](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webapps/) with a `Subject:` prefix of `[service-workers]`.\n\nUpdates to the spec must reference [resolved issues marked `needs spec`](https://github.com/w3c/ServiceWorker/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+label%3A%22needs+spec%22).\n\nTo make edits to the design, please send pull requests against the Nightly spec on the master branch. We use [bikeshed](https://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed). So, change and submit `docs/index.bs`. When your pull request is merged, Travis CI will automatically build the spec.\n\nFor normative changes, a corresponding [web-platform-tests](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt) PR is highly appreciated. Typically, both PRs will be merged at the same time. Note that a test change that contradicts the spec should not be merged before the corresponding spec change. If testing is not practical, please explain why and if appropriate [file an issue](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/issues/new) to follow up later. Add the `type:untestable` or `type:missing-coverage` label as appropriate.\n\nContributions to this repository are intended to become part of Recommendation-track documents\ngoverned by the [W3C Patent Policy](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy-20040205/) and\n[Software and Document License](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/copyright-software).

      "readme": "## What’s going on here?\n\nService workers are a new browser feature that provide event-driven scripts that run independently of web pages. Unlike other workers, service workers can be shut down at the end of events, note the lack of retained references from documents, and they have access to domain-wide events such as network fetches.\n\nService workers also have scriptable caches. Along with the ability to respond to network requests from certain web pages via script, this provides a way for applications to “go offline”.\n\nService workers are meant to replace the ([oft maligned](http://alistapart.com/article/application-cache-is-a-douchebag)) [HTML5 Application Cache](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsers.html#offline). Unlike AppCache, service workers are comprised of scriptable primitives with an extensive use of [Promises](//developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) that make it possible for application developers to build URL-friendly, always-available applications in a sane and layered way.\n\nTo understand the design and how you might build apps with service workers, see the [explainer document](explainer.md).\n\n## Spec and API development\n\nFor the nitty-gritty of the API, the draft W3C specifications are authoritative. [Service Workers Nightly](https://w3c.github.io/ServiceWorker/) is a living document. [Service Workers 1](https://w3c.github.io/ServiceWorker/v1/) is a subset of the nightly version that is advancing toward a W3C Recommendation. For implementers and developers who seek all the latest features, [Service Workers Nightly](https://w3c.github.io/ServiceWorker/) is a right document that is constantly reflecting new requirements. For version 1, contributors plan to focus on fixing bugs and resolving compatibility issues without including new features from the nightly version.\n\nSpec development happens via [issues in this repository](https://github.com/w3c/ServiceWorker/issues). For general discussion, please use the [public-webapps@w3.org mailing list](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webapps/) with a `Subject:` prefix of `[service-workers]`.\n\nUpdates to the spec must reference [resolved issues marked `needs spec`](https://github.com/w3c/ServiceWorker/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+label%3A%22needs+spec%22).\n\nTo make edits to the design, please send pull requests against the Nightly spec on the master branch. We use [bikeshed](https://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed). So, change `docs/index.bs` and submit it with the corresponding bikesheded `index.html`.\n\n## Examples\n\nThe W3C Web Mobile Group have defined a [series of use-cases where service worker is particularly useful](https://github.com/w3c-webmob/ServiceWorkersDemos). You can help by adding more use cases, draft implementation code, or even working examples once browsers support the required APIs.\n\n\n## About labels and milestones on issues\nThis is to explain how we use labels and milestones to triage the issues. Note: This is a draft, suggestions for improvements are welcomed.\n\n\n### Prioritization\n- **enhancement**: is for anything that was assessed as not having any impact on the decisions for the current milestone and can therefore be safely discussed, rejected or prioritized later.\n- **milestone**: is used to mark issues we agreed to get done in principle by a given revision. For the sake of efficiency, we tend to only focus on the current milestone and leave everything else without specific milestones.\n- **impacts MVP**: is used to mark issues impacting the “Minimal Viable Product”. The MVP is the minimal scope of API that can solve actual use cases. These issues have the highest priority.\n\n*Risk labels for impacts MVP issues*\n\n- **medium risk**: to further refine the “impacts MVP” issues. It indicates that the issue is moderately complex and that reaching a conclusion might take some time. These are of higher priority than issues with no risk label but are of lower priority than issues with a “high risk” label.\n- **high risk**: to further refine the “impacts MVP” issues. It indicates that the issue is significantly complex and that reaching a conclusion might take a lot of time and effort. These are of higher priority than issues with no risk label or a “medium risk” label.\n\n\n\n### Actions\n- **needs spec**: a decision has been made and the spec needs to be updated.\n- **spec detail**: has no significant implications for implementers nor web developers.\n- **decided**: to record that a decision has been made.\n- **invalid**: when something doesn’t constitute a valid issue.\n- **wontfix**: a decision has been made not to pursue this issue further.\n- **duplicate**: when a similar issue has already been filed.\n- **bug**: an oversight that needs to be fixed.\n\n\n### Areas\n- **fetch**: relates to Fetch\n- **lifecycle**: relates to lifecycle aspects of service worker\n- **cache**: relevant to the Cache APIs\n- **question**: not an actual issue. Items that have been filed in order to gain a better understanding of service worker.\n",

[Find an existing issue](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues) directly related to the contribution\n  2. [Add a new issue](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/new)\n\nIssues are where individual reports and Working Group discussions come together such \nthat the eventual consensus can be turned into official specification language.\n\nIf you are familiar with a [GitHub-based pull request contribution workflow](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/), \nplease note that **most issues are subject to quite a bit of discussion** before \nthey are ready for a pull request with specific wording changes. Please ensure\nthe full problem space of the issue is explored in the discussion, and that\nconsensus has been reached by the participants, before drafting a pull request.\n\n## Normative and/or substantive contributions\n\nThe CSS Working Group operates via the consensus of its membership, and discusses \nall significant matters prior to implementation.\n\nThe Editors responsible for a particular spec are responsible for triaging their\nissues on a regular basis; however note that sometimes this can take awhile\n(anywhere from a few days to a few years) depending on the complexity of the\nissue and the work schedules of people involved--this does not mean we are\nignoring the issue.\n\nFor an issue that requires WG discussion or approval, WG members can tag/label\nit 'Agenda+' to bring it to the Working Group's attention. Unfortunately,\nGitHub doesn't allow labelling permissions without repository write permissions,\nso if you believe an issue is urgent or discussion has stalled for awhile and\nthe WG's attention is needed to move forward, ask one of the editors to flag it.\n\nThe Working Group, aside from managing issues on GitHub, mainly discusses\nspecifications and requests on [the www-style public mailing list](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/),\nand in CSSWG meetings, whose minutes are posted to www-style.\n\n### After discussion\n\nOnce the Working Group has come to a consensus, the editor may draft up and\ncommit the relevant changes for review by other contributors or a contributor\nmay file a pull request against the issue for review by the editor(s). Since\nspecification wording is tricky, it is strongly recommended that the editors\nof that particular spec be involved, either as originator or as reviewer, in\nany changes. We also encourage other participants in the issue discussion to\nreview the changes and request corrections or improvements as necessary.\n\nPlease follow the [Pull Request template](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) \nwhen contributing to the repository.\n\n### Tests\n\nFor normative changes for any specification in\n[CR or later](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/current-work) as well as the pre-CR specifications listed\nbelow, a corresponding [web-platform-tests](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt) PR must be\nprovided, except if testing is not practical; for other specifications it is usually appreciated.\n\nTypically, both PRs will be merged at the same time. Note that a test change that contradicts the\nspec should not be merged before the corresponding spec change. If testing is not practical, please\nexplain why and if appropriate [file an issue](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/issues/new)\nto follow up later. Add the `type:untestable` or `type:missing-coverage` label as appropriate.\n\nThe pre-CR specifications with this testing requirement are currently:\n\n  * cssom\n  * cssom-view\n\n## Non-substantive contributions\n\nFor simple spelling, grammar, or markup fixes unrelated to the substance of a\nspecification, issuing a pull request without a corresponding issue is acceptable.\n\n## Further information\n\nSpecification source files are in [Bikeshed format](https://tabatkins.github.io/bikeshed/).\nThe CSSWG wiki has more information on other [CSSWG tooling](https://wiki.csswg.org/tools).\n\nSee [about:csswg](http://fantasai.inkedblade.net/weblog/2011/inside-csswg/)\nfor more information on how the CSSWG operates, delegates authority, and\nmakes decisions. Someday maybe we'll also have a useful official website.\n",

Source files for WCAG 2.0 are in the wcag20 folder and exists primarily for archival purposes. Do not edit content in that folder.\n\nContent for WCAG 2.1 and later is organized accordign to the file structure below. The WCAG repository contains source and auxiliary files for WCAG 2, Understanding WCAG 2, and eventually techniques. It also contains auxiliary files that support automated formatting of the document. To facilitate multi-party editing, each success criterion is in a separate file, consisting of a HTML fragment that can be included into the main guidelines. Key files include:\n\n* guidelines/index.html - the main guidelines file\n* guidelines/sc/<version>/*.html - files for each success criterion\n* guidelines/terms/<version>/*.html - files for each definition\n* understanding/<version>/*.html - understanding files for each success criterion\n\nWhere <version> is \"20\", content came from WCAG 2.0. \"21\" is used for content introduced in WCAG 2.1, \"22\" for WCAG 2.2, etc.\n\n## Editing Draft Success Criteria\n\n[Success Criteria Managers](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wiki/SC_Managers_Phase1) will prepare candidate success criteria, ready for inclusion in the guidelines document. To prepare success criteria, follow these steps:\n\n1. [Clone the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/), using the URI https://github.com/w3c/wcag.git to clone.\n1. Switch to the working branch for the proposal, which is named for the shortname of the draft success criterion and the issue number, concatenated together.\n1. Find the appropriate file for the success criterion in the guidelines/sc/21 folder, named the same as the start of the branch name, and open in an HTML-capable editor. Do the same with any definitions referenced by the success criterion, in the guidelines/terms/21 folder.\n1. Open the guidelines/index.html file and remove comment marks around the lines that reference the success criterion and terms you have edited..\n1. Follow the [success criteria format](#user-content-success-criteria-format) below to create the SC content.\n1. Save the file and commit the change. NOTE: It is important to also add a suitable 'commit message'. In the comments, reference the issue number from which the proposal was developed starting with a hash, e.g., `#1`. \n1. When the success criterion is ready for Working Group review, inform the chairs. Once the proposal has been accepted by the Working Group, the editors will merge the working branch into the master branch, which puts it in the editors' draft and eventual Technical Report publication.\n\n### Success Criteria Format\n\nSuccess criteria use a simple structure of HTML elements, with a few class attribute values, to ensure consistency. Enhancement scripts and style key off this structure. Content you provide is indicated in braces. Items after comments are optional.\n\n```html\n<section class=\"sc\">\n\t<h4>{SC Handle}</h4>\n\t<p class=\"conformance-level\">{Level}</p>\n\t<p class=\"change\">{Change}</p>\n\t<p>{Main SC Text}</p>\n\t<!-- if SC has sub-points -->\n\t<dl>\n\t\t<dt>{Point Handle}</dt>\n\t\t<dd>{Point Text}</dd>\n\t</dl>\n\t<!-- if SC has notes -->\n\t<p class=\"note\">{Note}</p>\n</section>\n```\n\nNote you do not provide the SC number. Numbers will be assigned, and most likely automatically generated, later.\n\nValues you provide are described below. Refer to [Success Criterion 2.2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#time-limits-required-behaviors) for an example of each of these pieces of content.\n\n<dl>\n\t<dt>{SC Handle}</dt>\n\t<dd>The short name of the SC. In SC 2.2.1 this is \"Timing Adjustable\".</dd>\n\t<dt>{Level}</dt>\n\t<dd>The conformance level of the SC. Values can be \"A\", \"AA\", or \"AAA\". Do not include the word \"Level\".</dd>\n\t<dt>{Change}</dt>\n\t<dd>Indicate whether the SC is unchanged from WCAG 2.0, changed, or new. Values can be \"Unchanged\", \"Changed\", or \"New\".</dd>\n\t<dt>{Main SC Text}</dt>\n\t<dd>The main text of the SC, or the starting paragraph. In SC 2.2.1 this is the content that begins \"For each time limit...\".</dd>\n\t<dt>{Point Handle}</dt>\n\t<dd>If the SC has bullets, each bullet has a handle. In SC 2.2.1 the first bullet point handle is \"Turn off\".</dd>\n\t<dt>{Point Text}</dt>\n\t<dd>The content of the bullet. In SC 2.2.1 the first bullet point text begins \"The user is allowed...\".</dd>\n\t<dt>{Note}</dt>\n\t<dd>If there is a note to the SC, provide it after the other content (without the starter \"Note\"). In SC 2.2.1, this is the content that begins \"This success criterion...\". If there is more than one note, multiple `<p class=\"note\">`elements may be provided.</dd>\n</dl>\n\n### Definitions\n\nIf you providing term definitions along with your SC, include them in the glossary. Position them in the appropriate alphabetical order with the rest of the terms and use the following format:\n\n```html\n<dt><dfn>{Term}</dfn></dt>\n<dd>{Definition}</dd>\n```\n\nThe ```dfn``` element tells the script that this is a term and causes special styling and linking features. To link to a term, use an `<a>` element without an `href` attribute; if the link text is the same as the term, the link will be correctly generated. For example, if there is a term `<dfn>web page</dfn>` on the page, a link in the form of `<a>web page</a>` will result in a proper link. If the link text has a different form from the canonical term, e.g., \"web pages\" (note the plural), you can provide a hint on the term definition with the `data-lt` attribute. In this example, modify the term to be `<dfn data-lt=\"web pages\">web page</dfn>`. Multiple alternate names for the term can be separated with pipe characters, with no leading or trailing space, e.g., `<dfn data-lt=\"web pages|page|pages\">web page</dfn>`.\n\n## Editing Draft Understanding Content\n\nThere is one Understanding file per success criterion, plus an index:\n\n* understanding/index.html - index page, need to uncomment or add a reference to individual Understanding pages as they are made available\n* understanding/<version>/*.html - files for each understanding page, named the same as the success criterion file in the guidelines\n\nFiles are populated with a template that provides the expected structure. Leave the template structure in place, and add content as appropriate within the sections. Elements with class=\"instructions\" provide guidance about what content to include in that section; you can remove those elements if you want but don't have to. The template for examples proposes either a bullet list or a series of sub-sections, choose one of those approaches and remove the other from the template. The template for techniques includes sub-sections for \"situations\", remove that wrapper section if not needed.\n\nUnderstanding files are referenced from the relevant Success Criterion on the WCAG specification; these links are put in by the script.\n\nThe formal publication location for Understanding pages is currently https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/. This content is updated as needed; and may be automated.\n\n## Editing Techniques\n\nTechniques are in the techniques folder, and grouped by technology into sub-folders. Each technique is a standalone file, which is in HTML format with a regular structure of elements, classes, and ids.\n\n### Technique File Structure\n\nThe [technique template](techniques/technique-template.html) shows the structure of techniques. Main sections are in top-level &lt;section> elements with specific IDs: meta, applicability, description, examples, tests, related, resources. The description and tests sections are required; the applicability and examples sections are recommended; the related and resources sections are optional. The meta section provides context for the technique during authoring but is removed for publication. The title of the technique is in the `<h1>` element. Elements with `class=\"instructions\"` provide information about populating the template. They should be removed as the technique is developed but if not removed, will be ignored by the generator. **Do not copy `class=\"instructions\"` on real content.**\n\nTechniques can use a temporary style sheet to facilitate review of drafts. This style sheet is replaced by other style sheets and structure for formal publication. To use this style sheet, add `<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"../../css/editors.css\"/>` to the head of the technique.\n\nThe generator used to publish techniques uses XML processing, so techniques must be well-formed XML. Techniques use HTML 5 structure so are actually [HTML Polyglot](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-polyglot/).  \n\n### Images, Examples, Cross References for Techniques\n\nTechniques can include images. Place the image file in the `img` folder of the relevant technology - meaning all techniques for a technology share a common set of images. Use a relative link to load the image. Most images should be loaded with a `<figure>` element and labeled with a `<figcaption>` positioned at the bottom of the figure. Small inline images may be loaded with a `<img>` element with suitable `alt` text.\n\nTechniques should include brief code examples to demonstrate how to author content that follows the technique. Code examples should be easy to read, and usually not complete content in themselves. More complete examples can be provided as [working examples](#user-content-provide-working-examples-of-techniques) (see below). Link to working examples at the bottom of each example, in a `<p class=\"working-example\">` element, containing a relative link to `../../working-examples/{example-name}/`.\n\nCross references to other techniques may be provided where useful. Generally they should be provided in the \"Related Techniques\" section but can be provided elsewhere. Use a relative link to reference the technique, `{Technique ID}` if the same technology, or `../{Technology}/{Technique ID}` otherwise. If the technique is still under development and does not have a formal ID, reference the path to the development file. If the technique is under development in a different branch, use an absolute URI to the rawgit version of the technique.\n\nCross references to guidelines and success criteria should use a relative URI to the *Understanding* page for that item. Cross references to other parts of the guidelines should use an absolute URI to the guidelines as published on the W3C TR page, a URI beginning with `https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#`. Note that references to guidelines or success criteria to which techniques relate are added by the generator upon publication based on information in the Understanding documents, so redundant links to those is not normally needed or advised.\n\n### Create Techniques\n\n[General priorities and process to work on techniques are maintained in the wiki](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wiki/Wcag21-techniques).\n\nNew techniques should use a filename that is derived from a shortened version of the technique title. Editors will assign the technique an ID and rename the file when it is accepted by the Working Group. For example, a technique \"Using the alt attribute on the img element to provide short text alternatives\" might use \"img-alt-short-text-alternatives.html\" as the filename. The editors will assign it a formal ID, and rename the file, when it is accepted by the Working Group.\n\nEach new technique should be created in a new branch. Set-up of the branch and file is automated via the create-techniques.sh script, which can be run with bash. The command line is:\n\n```Shell\nbash create-techniques.sh <technology> <filename> <type> \"<title>\"\n```\n\\<technology> is the technology directory for the technique\n\\<filename> is the temporary filename (without extension) for the technique\n\\<type> is \"technique\" or \"failure\"\n\\<title> is the title of the technique, enclosed in quotes and escaping special characters with \\\\\n\nThis automates the following steps:\n\n* Determine a filename for the technique that is likely to be descriptive, unique, and short.\n* Create a working branch named the same as the technique filename.\n* Copy the techniques/technique-template.html file into the appropriate technology folder for the technique, and give it the chosen file name.\n* In the section element with id \"meta\", indicate to which guideline or success criterion the technique relates, and whether the technique is sufficient, advisory, or a failure for that item. Multiple applicability are allowed.\n\nOnce a technique branch and file is set up, populate the content and request review:\n\n* Populate the template with appropriate content, using other techniques as examples for code formatting choices. Keep the existing structural sections from the template in place.\n* When the technique is ready for review, make a pull request into master.\n* If you wish to reference the draft technique from an Understanding document, use the technique's rawgit URI.\n* After a technique is approved, the chairs will assign it an ID and update links to it in the Undestanding documents. \n\n### Formatting Techniques\n\nTechniques in the repository are plain HTML files with minimal formatting. For publication to the editors' draft and W3C location, techniques are formatted by an XSLT-based generator managed by Apache Ant running in Java. Most people do not need to worry about this, but relevant files are the [Ant build file](build.xml) and [XSLT files](xslt).\n\nThe generator compiles the techniques together as a suite with formatting and navigation. It enforces certain structures, such as ordering top-level sections described above and standardizing headings. It attempts to process cross reference links to make sure the URIs work upon publication. One of the most substantial roles is to populate the Applicability section with references to the guidelines or success criteria to which the technique relates. The information for this comes from the Understanding documents. Proper use of the technique template is important to enable this functionality, and mal-formed techniques may cause the generator to fail.\n\n## Working Examples\n\nExamples in techniques should be brief easy-to-consume code samples of how the technique is used in content. Therefore examples should focus on the specific features the technique describes, and not include related content such as style, script, surrounding web content, etc.\n\nOften it is desirable to provide more comprehensive examples, which show the technique in action while not interfering with the main technique document. These examples also show the complete code required to make the technique operate, including full style and script files, images, page code, etc. Usually, these \"working examples\" are referenced at the bottom of the elided example which is included in the main technique.\n\nWorking examples are stored in the `working-examples` directory of the repository. Each example is in its own subdirectory, to contain the multiple files that may be necessary to make the example work. In some cases, multiple working examples will share common resources; these are stored in the appropriate sub-directory of the working-examples directory, e.g., `working-examples/css`, `working-examples/img`, `working-examples/script`. Reference these common resources when available; otherwise place resources in the working example directory, using subdirectories to organize when appropriate.\n\nTo create a working example:\n\n* Identify the name for the example, e.g., \"Using the alt attribute\".\n* Create a working branch for the example, whose name begins with the prefix `example-` and which otherwise semantically identifies the example, e.g., `example-alt-attribute`.\n* Create a directory for the example inside the working examples directory, using the semantic name for the example minus the prefix used in the branch name, e.g., `working-examples/alt-attribute/`.\n* If the primary example is HTML, name the file `index.html`. Otherwise, create a suitable file name.\n* Refer to resources shared among multiple examples using relative links, e.g., `../css/example.css`. Place other resources in the same directory as the main example, e.g., `working-examples/alt-attribute/css/alt.css`.\n* Reference working examples from techniques using the rawgit URI to the example in its development branch, e.g., `https://rawgit.com/w3c/wcag/master/working-examples/alt-attribute/`. Editors will update links when examples are approved.\n* When the example is complete and functional, submit a pull request into the master branch.\n",

      "readme": "i18n-checker - Java version\n============\n\n**Notice:** This project was discontinued in February 2014.\n\nA Java implementation of the [W3C Internationalization Checker](http://validator.w3.org/i18n-checker/). Provides an API for running internationalization (i18n) checks on a document.\n\n[![Build status image from travis-ci.org](https://travis-ci.org/w3c/i18n-checker.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/w3c/i18n-checker)\n\nContents:\n\n1. [Usage](#usage)\n2. [Developers](#developers)\n3. [Testing](#testing)\n4. [License](#license)\n\nUsage\n-----\nTo perform an i18n check, import [`org.w3.i18n.I18nChecker`](http://github.com/w3c/i18n-checker/blob/master/src/main/java/org/w3/i18n/I18nChecker.java) and use either:\n* `static List<Assertion> check(URL url)`, for online checks; or\n* `static List<Assertion> check(URL url, InputStream body, Map<String,List<String>> headers)`, for offline checks.\n\nThe results are provided as a list of  [`org.w3.i18n.Assertion`](https://github.com/w3c/i18n-checker/blob/master/src/main/java/org/w3/i18n/Assertion.java). An Assertion has an ID, level, HTML title, HTML description, and a list of contexts. Together these items say something thing about a document that was checked. For example, an Assertion could have:\n```\nid = charset_http\nlevel = INFO\nhtmlTitle = Charset declaration in HTTP response header 'Content-Type'\nhtmlDescription = …\ncontexts = [utf-8, Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8]\n```\n\nAn Assertion level can be `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, or `MESSAGE`. `MESSAGE` level Assertions contain only meta information about the operation of the checker. `WARNING` and `ERROR` level Assertions describe i18n problems with the document. In such cases the `htmlTitle` and `htmlDescription` provide advice on solving the problem. `INFO` Assertions contain useful information, relevant to the i18n of document (such as a list of the language and charset declarations in the document).\n\nContexts are often verbatim extracts from an HTML document. Depending on how you wish to use the contexts, you may need to remove extraneous newline, tab, and whitespace characters. If you wish to present the results in  HTML or XML, you should [escape](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7381974/which-characters-need-to-be-escaped-on-html) the contexts.\n\nHere's a simple example of how a List of `Assertion` can be displayed to a user:\n```java\n/* Runs the i18n-checker on the given URL and prints the results to the\n * standard output stream. */\nprivate static void printI18nCheck(java.net.URL url)\n        throws java.io.IOException {\n    // Run the checker on the remote Web page.\n    java.util.List<org.w3.i18n.Assertion> results =\n            org.w3.i18n.I18nChecker.check(url);\n    // Print the results.\n    for (Assertion assertion : results) {\n        System.out.printf(\n                \"(%s) %s\\n    Context: %s\\n\",\n                assertion.getLevel(),\n                assertion.getHtmlTitle(),\n                assertion.getContexts()\n                // Remove unwanted whitespace from verbatim contexts.\n                .toString().replaceAll(\"\\\\s+\", \" \"));\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe output generated by this method might look like:\n```\n…\n(INFO) Charset encoding declared in 'Content-Type' HTTP response header\n    Context: [utf-8, Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8]\n(INFO) Character encoding attribute in a <code>meta</code> tag\n    Context: [utf-8, <meta charset=\"utf-8\">]\n(INFO) Document Type Definition (DOCTYPE)\n    Context: [HTML5, <!DOCTYPE html>]\n(INFO) Language attribute in an opening <code>html</code> tag\n    Context: [en, <html lang=\"en\" >]\n(ERROR) <code>charset</code> attribute used on <code>link</code> or <code >a</code> elements\n    Context: [<link charset=\"utf-8\" href=\"main.css\" >]\n…\n```\n\nDevelopers\n----------\n**Please note:**  This project is still in the early stages of its development.\n\nThe **i18n-checker** has a simple design. The two classes,  [`org.w3.i18n.I18nChecker`](http://github.com/w3c/i18n-checker/blob/master/src/main/java/org/w3/i18n/I18nChecker.java) and [`org.w3.i18n.Assertion`](http://github.com/w3c/i18n-checker/blob/master/src/main/java/org/w3/i18n/Assertion.java), form the checker's API (as described above). Then there's:\n* [`org.w3.i18n.DocumentResource`](http://github.com/w3c/i18n-checker/blob/master/src/main/java/org/w3/i18n/DocumentResource.java), which represents a remote or local document to be checked;\n* [`org.w3.i18n.ParsedDocument`](http://github.com/w3c/i18n-checker/blob/master/src/main/java/org/w3/i18n/ParsedDocument.java), which is constructed with a `DocumentResource`, and is responsible for processing and analysing the document; and\n* [`org.w3.i18n.Check`](http://github.com/w3c/i18n-checker/blob/master/src/main/java/org/w3/i18n/Check.java), which uses the information prepared by `ParsedDocument` to create a list of assertions-- i.e. the results!\n\nThe relationship between `ParsedDocument` and `Check` is similar to the relationship between the _model_ and the _view_ in the Model–view–controller architectural pattern: The `ParsedDocument` contains most of the business logic, and does all the hard work of analysing a document, then the `Check` takes this information and renders it in to a list of `Assertion`.\n\n###To extend the functionality of the checker\n\nFirst, extend or expand `ParsedDocument`. Instances of `ParsedDocument` already have access to the document body, a map of HTTP response headers, a document model from the HTML parser (currently a `Source` object), and other details. Add your extra logic for processing the document, and then expose something useful for a `Check` object to use.\n\nSecond, extend or expand `Check`. Glance at `Check` and you'll notice: (1) a `Check` is instantiated with a `ParsedDocument`; (2) in the constructor, a list of `Assertion` is constructed; and (3) several methods that look like `private void addAssertionXYZ()` are called, which each add an `Assertion` to the list. (One of these methods might very well add nothing to the list if it finds nothing to report.) Add a new `addAssertionXYZ()` method, and have it use the extra details you exposed in `ParsedDocument`-- try to extract some really useful contexts for the end user. (NB: Make sure the new method gets called when `Check` is instantiated.)\n\nThirdly, your new `addAssertionXYZ()` method must construct a new `Assertion`. An `Assertion` has an ID, level, HTML title, HTML description, and a list of contexts. You can construct the assertion directly:\n```java\nnew Assertion(\n        \"example_id\",\n        Assertion.Level.MESSAGE,\n        \"This is an example\",\n        \"You needn't take any action relating to this message.\",\n        Arrays.asList(\"example context1\", \"example context2\"));\n```\n\nOr you can make use of the [`org.w3.i18n.AssertionProvider`](http://github.com/w3c/i18n-checker/blob/master/src/main/java/org/w3/i18n/AssertionProvider.java) class. `AssertionProvider` exposes `public static Assertion getForWith(String id, Assertion.Level level, List<String> contexts)`. This method takes the id and Level you provide, and finds a corresponding title and description. Then it creates a new Assertion with the details, plus the given list of contexts. `AssertionProvider` currently gets its definitions from a properties file: [`src/main/resources/assertions-EN.properties`](https://github.com/w3c/i18n-checker/blob/master/src/main/resources/assertions-EN.properties). To add your own definitions to `AssertionProvider`, you must modify this file (instructions are provided at the top of the file in a comment block).\n\nThe following guidelines should be observed:\n* `ParsedDocument` shouldn't make use of `Assertion`;\n* `Check` shouldn't make use of `DocumentResource`;\n* methods in `Check` shouldn't need to do any complicated processing, such as using the HTML parser; and\n* assertions are written for people who want to improve the i18n of their work-- advice is qualified by published W3C guidelines and specifications.\n\nTesting\n-------\nThe **i18n-checker** uses the JUnit testing framework. Test fixtures for various classes can be found in [`src/test/java/org/w3/i18n/`](http://github.com/w3c/i18n-checker/blob/master/src/test/java/org/w3/i18n/). Developers should expand these fixtures as they further develop the checker.\n\nIn addition to the regular unit tests, the classes [`org.w3.i18n.I18nTest`](http://github.com/w3c/i18n-checker/blob/master/src/test/java/org/w3/i18n/I18nTest.java) and [`org.w3.i18n.I18nTestRunnerTest`](http://github.com/w3c/i18n-checker/blob/master/src/test/java/org/w3/i18n/I18nTestRunnerTest.java) make use of legacy testing resources created for the old checker [old i18n checker](http://validator.w3.org/i18n-checker/). Have a look at these classes and the properties files in [`src/test/resources/`](http://github.com/w3c/i18n-checker/blob/master/src/test/resources/) to get a feel for how the legacy resources are used.\n\nLicense\n-------\nThe **i18n-checker** is released under the [W3C® Software License](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2002/copyright-software-20021231).\n\n> i18n-checker: https://github.com/w3c/i18n-checker\n>\n> Copyright © 2013 World Wide Web Consortium, (Massachusetts Institute of Technology, European Research Consortium for Informatics and Mathematics, Keio University, Beihang).

ITS 2.0 and this test suite have been developed by participants of the W3C MultilingualWeb-LT Working Group http://www.w3.org/International/multilingualweb/lt/ . Please provide comments on ITS 2.0 and the test suite on the ITS Interest Group mailing list http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-i18n-its-ig/\n\nFurther information about the test suite is available in [test-suite-howto.html](its2.0/test-suite-howto.html) (also avail. as [PDF](its2.0/test-suite-howto.pdf)) in this directory and in the [nif-conversion](its2.0/nif-conversion) subdirectory.\n\nLicensing Information\n=================\n\nThe following files are available under the W3C Test Suite License http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2008/04-testsuite-license.html\n\n* Input files, expected output files and implementers output files in the directories inputdata, expected and outputimplementers under https://github.com/finnle/ITS-2.0-Testsuite/tree/master/its2.0/\n\nValidating Input Test Files\n=================\nValidating XML test files\n-------------------------\n\n* Download and install Ant from http://ant.apache.org/\n\n* Run 'ant validate-xml' command in its2.0 directory\n\nValidating HTML test files\n--------------------------\n\n* Download and install Ant from http://ant.apache.org/\n\n* Download html5-its-tools from https://github.com/kosek/html5-its-tools\n\n* Modify its2.0/build.properties to point to your local copy of html5-its-tools\n\n* Run 'ant validate-html' command in its2.0 directory\n\nValidating all test files\n-------------------------\n\n* Make sure that XML and HTML validation described above works for you\n\n* Run 'ant' command in its2.0 directory\n\n* Please note that HTML schema doesn't supports RDFa so RDFa attributes are reported as errors\n\n* Please note that currently Schematron validation is not performed so some errors are not detected\n \nValidating Output Test Files\n=================\nTo validate test suite output files simply compile the test suite dashboard (this will only work if you have java installed and saxon downloaded):\n\n* Download saxon.jar from here: http://saxon.sourceforge.net/\n* Then use this command (Linux/Mac/Windows): \n  java -jar /path/of/file/saxon.jar  testsuiteMaster.xml  testsuiteDashboard.xsl -o:testSuiteDashboard.html\n* Upload newly compiled testsuiteDashboard.html to the git hub\n* Check the state of your files in the related data categories on this web page:\n  http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.github.com/w3c/its-2.0-testsuite/blob/master/its2.0/testSuiteDashboard.html\n\nExplanations of states :\n* N/A = the implementer did not commit to run the test.\n* OK = the output file is identical to the reference output file.\n* error = an error occurred, e.g. the output file is not available or it is not identical to the reference output file. Move the mouse over error to see details.\n* fnf: the output file from the implementer has not been found.\n\nValidating NIF output files\n---------------------------\nNote: The conversion to NIF is not a normative part of the ITS 2.0 specification.\nPrerequisites: Java and Unix Shell\n* create a temporary folder for output files (hence called $datafolder)\n* read ITS files from \"its2.0/nif-conversion/input/\" one by one, convert to NIF and write output files in turtle to $datafolder\n* go to directory \n  cd its2.0/nif-conversion/sparqltest\n* run :\n  ./executeTests.sh ../relative/pathTo/$datafolder\n  \nExplanations of output:\n* If no message appears between \"Running: test1.sparql\" and \"Done: test1.sparql\" the test was successfull. \n* Otherwise the output filename and additional debug output is shown.\n"

EPUB 3 publications are checked against the EPUB 3.0.1 family of specifications.\n\n[EPUBCheck 4.2.0-rc](https://github.com/w3c/epubcheck/releases/tag/v4.2.0-rc) is the release candidate of the forthcoming 4.2.0 version, to be used for testing and preparing the update in production workflows. It features complete support for the EPUB 3.2 family of specifications.\n\n\n## Documentation\n\nDocumentation on how to **use** EPUBCheck, to **contribute** to the project or to **translate** messages is available on the [EPUBCheck wiki](https://github.com/w3c/epubcheck/wiki).\n\nTechnical discussions are held on our public [mailing list](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-epubcheck/).

To participate in the discussion, simply send an email to [public-epubcheck@w3.org](mailto:public-epubcheck-request@w3.org).\n\nHistorical archives of discussions prior to October 2017 are stored at the old [EPUBCheck Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/epubcheck).\n\n## Building EPUBCheck\n\nTo build epubcheck from the sources you need Java Development Kit (JDK) 1.7 or above and [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) 3.0 or above installed.\n\nYou will also need Python to be able to run the BookReporter and related tools.\n\nBuild and run tests:\n\n```\n$ mvn install\n```\nWill copy `.*jar` files and packages to `target/` folder...\n\n## Credits\n\nMost of the EPUBCheck functionality comes from the schema validation tool [Jing](http://www.thaiopensource.com/relaxng/jing.html) and schemas that were developed by [IDPF](http://www.idpf.org/) and [DAISY](http://www.daisy.org/). Initial EPUBCheck development was largely done at [Adobe Systems](http://www.adobe.com/).\n\nInitial (pre 2012) authors and contributors to EPUBCheck include: Peter Sorotokin, Garth Conboy, Markus Gylling, Piotr Kula, Paul Norton, Jessica Hekman, Liza Daly, George Bina, Bogdan Iordache, Ionut-Maxim Margelatu\n\nEPUBCheck 4.0 was largely developed by\n* [DAISY](http://www.daisy.org/), namely: Romain Deltour, Markus Gylling\n* [Barnes & Noble](https://www.barnesandnoble.com), namely: Steve Antoch, Arwen Pond\n\nRegular contributors between 2012 and 2017 include: Romain Deltour, Tobias Fischer, Markus Gylling, Satoshi KOJIMA, Thomas Ledoux, Masayoshi Takahashi\n\nMany thanks are also extended to the numerous people who have contributed to the evolution of EPUBCheck through bug reports and patches!\n\n## Donators\n\nThe following organizations are supporting the development of EPUBCheck by their contribution to the [fundraising initiative](https://www.w3.org/publishing/epubcheck_fundraising):\n\n<p float=\"left\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.macmillanlearning.com\"><img alt=\"MacMillan Learning\" src=\"https://www.w3.org/publishing/donators_logos/MacLearn_logo_cmyk.png\" width=\"200\" hspace=\"20\" align=\"middle\"/></a>\n  <a href=\"https://www.google.com\"><img alt=\"Google\" src=\"https://www.w3.org/publishing/donators_logos/Google.png\" width=\"400\" hspace=\"20\" align=\"middle\"/></a>\n  <a href=\"http://daisy.org\"><img alt=\"DAISY\" src=\"https://www.w3.org/publishing/donators_logos/daisy_high.jpg\" width=\"100\" hspace=\"20\" align=\"middle\"/></a>\n  <a href=\"https://pubhub.dk\"><img alt=\"Publizon A/S\" src=\"https://www.w3.org/publishing/donators_logos/publizon-logo.jpg\" width=\"100\" hspace=\"20\" align=\"middle\"/></a>\n  <a href=\"https://www.wiley.com\"><img alt=\"Wiley\" src=\"https://www.w3.org/publishing/donators_logos/Wiley_Wordmark_black.png\" width=\"200\" hspace=\"20\" align=\"middle\"/></a>\n  <a href=\"https://www.hachette.com\"><img alt=\"Hachette Livre\" src=\"https://www.w3.org/publishing/donators_logos/Hachette%20Livre.jpg\" width=\"300\" hspace=\"20\" align=\"middle\"/></a>\n  <a href=\"https://www.learningmate.com\"><img alt=\"LearningMate Solutions Inc\" src=\"https://www.w3.org/publishing/donators_logos/LearningMate%20Logo.png\" width=\"100\" hspace=\"20\" align=\"middle\"/></a>\n  <a href=\"https://www.voyager.co.jp\"><img alt=\"Voyager Japan, Inc.\" src=\"https://www.w3.org/publishing/donators_logos/rectangle_VJstar_logo_512.jpg\" width=\"100\" hspace=\"20\" align=\"middle\"/></a>\n  <a href=\"https://qainfotech.com\"><img alt=\"QA Info Tech\" src=\"https://www.w3.org/publishing/donators_logos/QA%20InfoTech%20Logo%20PNG%20Format.png\" width=\"200\" hspace=\"20\" align=\"middle\"/></a>\n  <a href=\"https://wwnorton.com\"><img alt=\"W.

[Installation](#1-installation)\n1. [Running](#2-running)\n1. [Testing](#3-testing)\n1. [JS API](#4-js-api)\n1. [REST API](#5-rest-api)\n1. [Profiles](#6-profiles)\n1. [Validation events](#7-validation-events)\n1. [Writing rules](#8-writing-rules)\n\n## 1. Installation\n\nSpecberus is a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) application, [distributed through npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/specberus).\nAlternatively, you can clone [the repository](https://github.com/w3c/specberus) and run:\n\n```bash\n$ npm install -d\n```\n\nIn order to get all the dependencies installed. Naturally, this requires that you have a reasonably\nrecent version of Node.js installed.\n\n## 2. Running\n\nCurrently there is no shell to run Specberus. Later we will add both Web and CLI interfaces based\non the same core library.\n\n### Syntax and command-line parameters\n\n```bash\n$ W3C_API_KEY=\"<YOUR W3C API KEY>\" npm start [PORT]\n```\n\nSpecberus relies on the [W3C API](http://w3c.github.io/w3c-api/) to run a few checks. You will need to provide [your key](http://w3c.github.io/w3c-api/#apikeys) in an environment variable `W3C_API_KEY`\n\nMeaning of positional parameters:\n\n1. `PORT`: where Specberus will be listening for HTTP connections.\n(Default `80`.)\n\nExamples:\n\n```bash\n$ W3C_API_KEY=\"<YOUR W3C API KEY>\" npm start\n$ W3C_API_KEY=\"<YOUR W3C API KEY>\" npm start 3001\n```\n\nSet the environment variable `DEBUG` to run in *debug mode* instead:\n\n```bash\n$ DEBUG=true W3C_API_KEY=\"<YOUR W3C API KEY>\" npm start\n```\n\nThis modifies the behaviour of certain parts of the application to facilitate debugging.\neg, CSS and JS resources will *not* be loaded in their minified/uglified forms\n(the web UI will load `bootstrap.css`, `bootstrap.js` and `jquery.js` instead of `bootstrap.min.css`, `bootstrap.min.js` and `jquery.min.js`).\n\nIf Specberus is *not* going to be served from the root directory of a domain, or if it will be served through a proxy,\nset also `BASE_URI` pointing to the public root URI of Specberus; eg\n\n```bash\n$ BASE_URI=https://spec-store.com/check/ W3C_API_KEY=deadbeef npm start\n$ BASE_URI=/hostname/can/be/omitted/ W3C_API_KEY=deadbeef npm start 88\n```\n\n## 3. Testing\n\nTesting is done using mocha. Simply run:\n\n```bash\n$ W3C_API_KEY=\"<YOUR W3C API KEY>\" mocha\n```\n\nfrom the root and you will be running the test suite. Mocha can be installed with:\n\n```bash\n$ npm install -g mocha\n```\n\nSome of the tests can on occasion take a long time, or fail outright because a remote service is\nunavailable. To work around this, you can set SKIP_NETWORK:\n\n```bash\n$ SKIP_NETWORK=1 W3C_API_KEY=\"<YOUR W3C API KEY>\" mocha\n```\n\n## 4. JS API\n\nThe interface you get when you `require(\"specberus\")` is that from `lib/validator`. It returns a\n`Specberus` instance that is properly configured for operation in the Node.js environment\n(there is nominal support for running Specberus under other environments, but it isn't usable at this time).\n\n(See also [the REST API](#5-rest-api).)\n\n### `validate(options)`\n\nThis method takes an object with the following fields:\n\n* `url`: URL of the content to check. One of `url`, `source`, `file`, or `document` must be\n  specified and if several are they will be used in this order.\n* `source`: A `String` with the content to check.\n* `file`: A file system path to the content to check.\n* `document`: A DOM `Document` object to be checked.\n* `profile`: A profile object which defines the validation. Required. See below.\n* `events`: An event sink which supports the same interface as Node.js's `EventEmitter`. Required. See\n  below for the events that get generated.\n\n### `extractMetadata(options)`\n\nThis method eventually extends `this` with metadata inferred from the document.\nOnce the [event `end-all`](#validation-events) is emitted, the metadata should be available in a new property called `meta`.\n\nThe `options` accepted are equal to those in `validate()`, except that a `profile` is not necessary and will be ignored (finding out the profile is one of the\ngoals of this method).\n\n`this.meta` will be an `Object` and may include up to 15 properties described below:\n\n* `profile`\n* `title`: The (possible) title of the document.\n* `docDate`: The date associated to the document.\n* `thisVersion`: URL of this version of the document.\n* `latestVersion`: URL of the latest version of the document.\n* `previousVersion`: URL of the previous version of the document (the last one, if multiple are shown).\n* `editorsDraft`: URL of the latest editor's draft.\n* `delivererIDs`: ID(s) of the deliverer(s); an `Array` of `Number`s.\n* `editorIDs`: ID(s) of the editor(s) responsible for the document; an `Array` of `Number`s.\n* `informative`: Whether the document in informative or not\n* `rectrack`: Whether the document in on REC track or not\n* `process`: The process rules link.\n* `sameWorkAs`: The previous shortlink if any.\n* `implementationFeedbackDue`: The implementation review date for CRs\n* `prReviewsDue`: The review date for PRs\n* `implementationReport`: Implementation report link for CRs, PRs and RECs\n\nIf some of these pieces of metadata cannot be deduced, that key will not exist, or its value will not be defined.\n\nThis is an example of the value of `Specberus.meta` after the execution of `Specberus.extractMetadata()`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"profile\": \"WD\",\n  \"title\": \"Title of the spec\",\n  \"docDate\": \"2016-2-3\",\n  \"thisVersion\": \"http://www.w3.org/TR/2016/WD-foobar-20160203/\",\n  \"latestVersion\": \"http://www.w3.org/TR/foobar/\",\n  \"previousVersion\": \"http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/WD-foobar-20150101/\",\n  \"editorsDraft\": \"http://w3c.github.io/foobar/\",\n  \"delivererIDs\": [123, 456],\n  \"editorIDs\": [ 12345 ],\n  \"informative\": false,\n  \"rectrack\": true,\n  \"process\": \"http://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/\" }\n}\n```\n\n## 5. REST API\n\nSimilar to the [JS API](#4-js-api), Specberus exposes a REST API via HTTP too.\n\nThe endpoint is `<host>/api/`.\nUse either `url` or `file` to pass along the document (neither `source` nor `document` are allowed).\n\nNote: If you want to use the public W3C instance of Specberus, you can replace `<host>` with `https://www.w3.org/pubrules`.\n\nThere are three `GET` methods available.\n\n### `version`\n\nReturns the version string, eg `1.5.3`.\n\n### `metadata`\n\nExtract all known metadata from a document; see [below](#return-values) for information about the return value.\n\n### `validate`\n\nCheck the document ([syntax](#validateoptions)).\nMany of [the options understood by the JS method `validate`](#validateoptions) are accepted.\n\nThe special profile `auto` is also available.\n\n### Examples\n\n* `<host>/api/version`\n* `<host>/api/metadata?url=http://example.com/doc.html`\n* `<host>/api/validate?file=/home/me/docs/spec.html`\n* `<host>/api/validate?file=draft2.html&profile=WD&validation=simple-validation&processDocument=2015`\n\n### Return values\n\nMethods `metadata` and `validate` return a JSON object with these properties:\n\n* `success` (`boolean`): whether the operation succeeded, or not.\n* `errors` (`array`): all errors found.\n* `warnings` (`array`): all warnings.\n* `info` (`array`): additional, informative messages.\n* `metadata` (`object`): extracted metadata; [see structure here](#extractmetadataoptions).\n\nIf there is an internal error, the document cannot be retrieved or is not recognised, or validation fails, both methods would return HTTP status code `400`.\nAlso, in the case of `validate`, `success` would be `false` and `errors.length > 0`.\n\nThis is an example of a successful validation of a document, with profile `auto`:\n\n```json\n{ \"success\": true,\n  \"errors\": [],\n  \"warnings\":\n   [ \"headers.ol-toc\",\n     \"links.linkchecker\",\n     \"links.compound\",\n     \"headers.dl\" ],\n  \"info\":\n   [ \"sotd.diff\",\n     \"structure.display-only\",\n     \"structure.display-only\",\n     \"structure.display-only\",\n     \"validation.wcag\" ],\n  \"metadata\":\n   { \"profile\": \"WD\",\n     \"title\": \"Character Model for the World Wide Web: String Matching and Searching\",\n     \"docDate\": \"2016-4-7\",\n     \"thisVersion\": \"http://www.w3.org/TR/2016/WD-charmod-norm-20160407/\",\n     \"latestVersion\": \"http://www.w3.org/TR/charmod-norm/\",\n     \"previousVersion\": \"http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/WD-charmod-norm-20151119/\",\n     \"editorsDraft\": \"http://w3c.github.io/charmod-norm/\",\n     \"delivererIDs\": [ 32113 ],\n     \"editorIDs\": [ 33573 ],\n     \"rectrack\": false,\n     \"informative\": false,\n     \"process\": \"http://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/\",\n     \"url\": \"https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/WD-charmod-norm-20160407/\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWhen the profile is given by the user (instead of being set to `auto`), fewer items of metadata are returned.\n\n`metadata` returns a similar structure, where all values are empty arrays, except for the key `metadata` which contains the metadata object.\n\n## 6. Profiles\n\nProfiles are simple objects that support the following API:\n\n* name: A `String` being the name of this profile.\n* rules: An `Array` of rule objects which are checked in this profile.\n\nA profile is basically a configuration of what to check. You can load a specific profile from under\n`lib/profiles` or create your own.\n\nHere follows the current hierarchy of profiles. Each profile inherits all rules from its parent profile.\nProfiles that are identical to its parent profile, ie that do not add any new rules, are marked too.\n\n* `dummy`\n* `base`\n  * `TR`\n    * `WG-NOTE`\n      * `FPWG-NOTE` (identical)\n    * `WG-NOTE-Echidna`\n    * `IG-NOTE`\n      * `FPIG-NOTE` (identical)\n    * `WD`\n      * `WD-Echidna`\n    * `FPWD` (identical)\n    * `PR`\n      * `PR-AMENDED` (identical)\n    * `CR`\n      * `CR-AMENDED` (identical)\n      * `CR-Echidna`\n    * `FPCR`\n    * `REC`\n      * `REC-AMENDED` (identical)\n    * `REC-OBSOLETE`\n    * `REC-RSCND`\n    * `REC-SUPERSEDED`\n  * `Submission`\n    * `SUBM`\n    * `MEM-SUBM`\n\n## 7. Validation events\n\nFor a given checking run, the event sink you specify will be receiving a bunch of events as\nindicated below. Events are shown as having parameters since those are passed to the event handler.\n\n* `start-all(profile-name)`: Fired first to indicate that the profile's checking has started.\n* `end-all(profile-name)`: Fired last to indicate that the profile's checking has completed. When\n  you receive this you are promised that all testing operations, including asynchronous ones, have\n  terminated.\n* `done(rule-name)`: Fired when a specific rule has finished processing, including its asynchronous\n  tasks.\n* `ok(rule-name)`: Fired to indicate that a rule has succeeded. There is only one `ok` per rule.\n  There cannot also be `err` events but there can be `warning` events.\n* `err(error-name, data)`: Fired when an error is detected. The `data` contains further details,\n  that depend on the error but *should* feature a `message` field. There can be multiple errors for\n  a given rule. There cannot also be `ok` events but there can be `warning`s.\n* `warning(warnings-name, data)`: Fired for non-fatal problems with the document that may\n  nevertheless require investigation. There may be several for a rule.\n* `info(info-name, data)`: Fired for additional information items detected by the validator.\n* `metadata(key, value)`: Fired for every piece of document metadata found by the validator.\n* `exception(message)`: Fired when there is a system error, such as a *File not found* error. `message`\n  contains details about this error. All exceptions are displayed on the error console in addition to\n  this event being fired.\n\n## 8. Writing rules\n\nRules are simple modules that just expose a `check(sr, cb)` method. They receive a Specberus object\nand a callback, use the Specberus object to fire validation events and call the callback when\nthey're done.\n\nThe Specberus object exposes the following API that's useful for validation:\n\n* `$`. A jQuery-like interface to the document being checked.\n* `loader`. The loader object that loaded the content, which exposes the content's `url` and\n  `source` if they are known.\n* `sink`. The event target on which to fire validation events.\n* `version`. The Specberus version.\n* `checkSelector(selector, rule-name, cb)`. Some rules need to do nothing other than to check that a\n  selector returns some content. For this case, the rule can just call this method with the selector\n  and its callback, and Specberus will conveniently take care of all the rest.\n* `norm(text)`. Returns a whitespace-normalised version of the text.\n* `getDocumentDate()`. Returns a Date object that matches the document's date as specified in the\n  headers' h2.\n* `getDocumentDateElement()`. Returns the element that contains the document's date.\n",

The group has defined and published 7 documents, namely:\n\n1. [CSV on the Web: A Primer](http://www.w3.org/TR/2016/NOTE-tabular-data-primer-20160225/)\n1. [Model for Tabular Data and Metadata on the Web](https://www.w3.org/TR/2015/REC-tabular-data-model-20151217/)\n1. [Metadata Vocabulary for Tabular Data](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/REC-tabular-metadata-20151217/)\n1. [Generating JSON from Tabular Data on the Web](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/REC-csv2json-20151217/)\n1. [Generating RDF from Tabular Data on the Web](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/REC-csv2rdf-20151217/)\n1.

[Use Cases and Requirements](http://www.w3.org/TR/2016/NOTE-csvw-ucr-20160225/)\n\nThe group was chaired by [Jeni Tennison](http://theodi.org/team/jeni-tennison) and [Dan Brickley](http://danbri.org/). The W3C staff contact was [Ivan Herman](http://www.w3.org/People/Ivan/). The group completed its work in February 2016, and is officially closed in March 2016.\n\nThe repository includes a [final release](https://github.com/w3c/csvw/releases/tag/final-release-WG-2016), representing the status of the repository when the Working Group was closed.\n\n## The Present ##\n\nAfter the closure of the Working Group the activity around CSV (and, in more general, tabular) data on the Web has been taken up by the [CSV on the Web Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/csvw/). All discussions on new possible features, implementation experiences, possible issues, etc, are conducted in that community group, which is open to everyone. Although the Community Group is not allowed to make changes on the official documents, this repository is used for issue management, new documents, experimentations, etc. If you are interested by this area, please [join the Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/csvw/join)!\n",

      "readme": "# tweetie\n\nReports on IRC when the user is mentioned on Twitter, allows to reply or tweet\n\n## Dependencies\n\n* POE, POE::Component::IRC, POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::BotCommand (Debian packages `libpoe-perl` and `libpoe-component-irc-perl`)\n* Net::Twitter::Lite::WithAPIv1_1 and Net::OAuth (Debian packages `libnet-oauth-perl` and `libnet-twitter-lite-perl`)\n* Net::OAuth::Simple (not in Debian, find it on [CPAN](https://metacpan.org/pod/Net::OAuth::Simple))\n\n## Configuration\n\ntweetie parses `$HOME/.tweetie.pl` and expects it to define a few variables.\nAs a minimum, it has to contain\n\n    $consumer_key = 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX;\n    $consumer_secret = 'YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY;\n    %irc_config = (\n     server => 'the.irc.server',\n    );\n\n`$consumer_key` and `$consumer_secret` are the Twitter API key and secret you wish to use, respectively.\nGo to [apps.twitter.com](https://apps.twitter.com/) and select \"Create\nNew App\" to generate keys.\n\n`%irc_config` is a hash that specifies how to connect to the IRC server.  This is passed directly to `POE::Component::IRC->spawn`; refer to the [POE IRC library documentation](https://metacpan.org/pod/POE::Component::IRC#spawn) for details about legal keys and values.\n\nRun tweetie from the command line:\n\n    perl tweetie.pl\n\nIt tries to connect to the IRC server configured in `.tweetie.pl` and\nprints some diagnostic output. A line `irc_001` means connection was\nsuccessful.\n\n## Usage\n\nOnce tweetie is running and connected to the IRC server, invite it to\na channel:\n\n    /invite tweetie\n\n(The nickname can be changed in the configuration file, see above.)\nTweetie can be on multiple channels at once and can be connected to\nmultiple Twitter accounts, one per IRC channel.\n\nIf tweetie has been on this channel before, it may remember what it\nwas doing there. If it joins the channel and says: \"Hi, I'm tweeting\nas JoeTweeter\" and JoeTweeter is indeed the Twitter handle you want to\nuse, it means it is already connected to Twitter and you can skip this\nstep. Otherwise, connect to a Twitter account in two steps:\n\n    tweetie, login\n\n(A `:` instead of a `,` works, too.) Tweetie replies with a URL\n(`https://api.twitter.com/...`). Copy and paste that into a browser\n(making sure you have JavaScript and cookies turned on). On the\nresulting Web page, enter the username (or e-mail) and password of the\nTwitter account and press \"Authorize app\".\n\nNote: if you are not asked for a username and password, the browser is\nprobably already logged in to Twitter. Make sure it is logged in to\nthe right account, or \"sign out\" first and try the same URL again.\n\nTwitter should now show a Web page with a 6-digit number. Go back to\nIRC and give that number to tweetie (replacing 123456 with the number\nfrom the Web page):\n\n    tweetie, pin 123456\n\nTweetie should reply with: “tweetie is now tweeting as JoeTweeter\" (or\nwhatever the Twitter account).\n\nNow that tweetie is connected to Twitter, simply watch the channel for\nany messages, i.e., tweets from others that mention your Twitter\nhandle.\n\nTo tweet something yourself, use tweetie's `say` command:\n\n    tweetie, say Feeling #happy. The #sun is shining.\n\nTweetie also has commands `reply`, to reply to the most recent\nmessage:\n\n    tweetie, reply Thanks!\n\nand `status`, to show your own most recent tweet:\n\n    tweetie, status\n\nThere is no command to make tweetie quit. To make it stop listening to\nTwitter, use the `login` command (and ignore the URL it prints). Then\nkick it off the channel:\n\n    tweetie, login\n    /kick tweetie\n\nIf you forget the login command, tweetie continues to listen to\nTwitter and forward tweets to the channel, even after it has been\nkicked off.\n\n## Known bugs\n\nTweetie doesn't reconnect to IRC after a network error. It has to be\nkilled and restarted.\n\n## Development\n\ntweetie's source repository lives at <https://github.com/w3c/tweetie>.\n"

This will bring you to the GitHub detail page of that file where you can start editing the file using the edit button (“pen icon”) in the top right corner, if you’re logged into Github. [Here’s an example in the Images Tutorial.][exmpImg]\n\nYou can start editing right away. We use the standard Markdown syntax. If you get the following note, this is expected behavior:\n\n> You are editing a file in a project you do not have write access to. We are forking this project for you (if one does not yet exist) to write your proposed changes to. Submitting a change to this file will write it to a new branch in your fork so you can send a pull request.\n\nIt is technical for “All right, make your edits, we make sure you can send them in as a proposal!”\n\nDon’t forget to add some descriptive text at the bottom that comments your change. Try to be concise. Klick the “Propose this change” button to continue. Then you get another comment field, you can write down your motivation for the change here. Once you click “Send pull request”, the editor will be notified of your proposal and may adopt it.\n\nNote that the changes are not immediately reflected on any page. If you want to see your changes in HTML that way is more technical and is described briefly in the following part of the document. But there is a preview button in the editor that gives you a fairly good example of how the rendered HTML will look like.\n\n[LivePage]:https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/\n[GHPage]:http://w3c.github.io/wai-tutorials/\n[exmpIMG]:https://github.com/w3c/wai-tutorials/blob/master/source/images/informative.html.erb.md\n",

By committing here, you agree to that licensing of your contributions.\n\nIf you are not the sole contributor to a contribution (pull request), please identify all contributors in the pull request comment.\n\nTo add a contributor (other than yourself, that's automatic), mark them one per line as follows:\n\n```\n+@github_username\n```\n\nIf you added a contributor by mistake, you can remove them in a comment with:\n\n```\n-@github_username\n```\n\nIf you are making a pull request on behalf of someone else but you had no part in designing the feature, you can remove yourself with the above syntax.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright is a very important part of standardization activities. It allows the standards development organization to maintain vendor neutral control over a specification, and thus protect the consensus found within a Working Group.\n\nIn the course of the development of materials within the W3C, Task Force Participants will make contributions. Those contributions will be integrated into the jointly developed work thus creating shared copyright on the Task Force Participant's contribution. Most W3C Specifications contain a section with acknowledgement of contributions.\n\nTask Force Participants grant to the W3C a perpetual, nonexclusive, royalty-free, world-wide right and license under any Task Force Participant's copyrights on his or her contributions, to copy, publish and distribute the contribution under a license of W3C's choosing. Additionally, the Task Force Participant grants a right and license of the same scope to any derivative works prepared by the W3C and based on, or incorporating all or part of, his or her contribution and that any derivative works of this contribution prepared by the W3C shall be solely owned by the W3C. Furthermore, the Task Force Participant understands that W3C will be able to exercise all rights as a copyright owner of Task Force Participant's contribution, including enforcement against infringers without additional agreement or notice.\n\nNothing in this agreement restricts the Task Force Participant from using their individual contributions as they wish, even if those have later been amalgamated into joint works. Where W3C releases materials under a permissive license such as the W3C Software License or CC-BY, nothing in this agreement should be read to restrict the Task Force Participant from exercising the permissions granted by that license. The Task Force Participant represents that they are legally entitled to grant the above license. If their employer(s) have rights to intellectual property that the Task Force Participant creates that includes the contributions, they represent that they have received permission to make contributions on behalf of that employer or that the employer has waived such rights for the contributions to W3C.\n\n## Decency\n\nThe Task Force Participant will participate in the W3C Group in a decent way.

      "readme": "# Requirements for Chinese Text Layout | 中文排版需求\n\nThis group explores gaps and requirements for support of languages using Simplified and Traditional Chinese on the Web and in eBooks.\n\n本小组探讨在网页和电子书中使用简体、繁体中文时的各语言、文种支持的需求以及目前差距。\n\nIt aims to address the problem that experts often don't know how to tell the W3C what problems exist for support of their script on the Web, and the W3C often doesn't know how to contact people who can help when questions arise.\n\n很多语言专家往往不知道如何告诉 W3C 在网页上支持自己语言、文种；而 W3C 也不知道如何联系到能回答问题的人，本小组的目标就是在于解决这种情况。\n\nSome experts go a step further, and contribute to a gap-analysis or requirements document.\n\n一些语言和排版专家会更深入地参与小组工作，为差距分析和需求文档做出贡献。\n\nTopics for discussion are suggested by [the gap-analysis template](https://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/templates/gap-analysis/gap-analysis_template.html). This work feeds into the [language matrix](https://w3c.github.io/typography/gap-analysis/language-matrix.html) which gives an overview of languages needing attention.  The focus is especially on typographic features for which information in English is typically hard to find, such as justification, letter-spacing, vertical text, text decoration, page layout, emphasis, etc. We want to ensure that we have captured local user needs in CSS, HTML, Timed Text, Web Payments, Web Publishing, and the many other specifications that the W3C produces.\n\n讨论的议题写在[差距分析模板（英文）](https://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/templates/gap-analysis/gap-analysis_template.html)中。这项工作源自列出了需要关注文种概要的[文种矩阵](https://w3c.github.io/typography/gap-analysis/language-matrix.html) 。特别关注于一些用英文撰写的、其他地方难以找到的字体排印特性，比如分词连写、字距、竖排、文本装饰、排版、强调方式等等。我们希望保证我们要能覆盖用户在 CSS、HTML、时间轴文本、网页支付、网页出版等的需要，以及其他 W3C 出台的规范。\n\n### Documents 文档\n\n- [Chinese Layout Gap Analysis | 中文支持差距分析](https://w3c.github.io/clreq/gap-analysis/)\n- [Requirements for Chinese Text Layout | 中文排版需求 (ED)](https://w3c.github.io/clreq/) ([WD](https://www.w3.org/TR/clreq/))\n\n### Following 跟踪\n\nRather than just 'Watch' this repository, it is best to subscribe to the [public-i18n-cjk](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-i18n-cjk/) mailing list. That list is notified once a day (in digest form) about not only changes to this repository, but also about other W3C Working Group issues related to the Chinese writing systems. (Please use github issues rather than the mailing list to send feedback. The main purpose of the public-i18n-cjk mailing list is for notifications; meeting minutes are also sent to public-i18n-cjk.)\n\n相比于“Watch”此仓库，订阅 [public-i18n-cjk](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-i18n-cjk/) 邮件列表会更好。该列表每天以摘要形式通知此仓库的活动以及其他W3C工作组中与中文书写系统相关的问题。（请使用 GitHub Issues 而不是邮件列表发送反馈，因为 public-i18n-cjk 邮件列表的主要作用是提醒邮件及发布会议纪要。）\n\nYou can find a list of open issues, including those from W3C Working Groups, on the [Layout Tracker](https://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/textlayout/?filter=clreq) page. (That link applies a `clreq` filter.)\n\n您可以在[排版问题跟踪器](https://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/textlayout/?filter=clreq)页面上找到尚未解决的问题列表，包括来自 W3C 工作组的问题。\n\n### Contributing 贡献\n\nAll contributors should read and agree with [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/w3c/clreq/blob/gh-pages/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n所有贡献者都应阅读并同意[CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/w3c/clreq/blob/gh-pages/CONTRIBUTING.md)。\n\nPlease use the [GitHub issue list](https://github.com/w3c/clreq/issues) to report issues for language support, for discussions, and to send feedback about documents.  (Learn [how GitHub issues work](http://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/guidelines/issues.html).)\n\n请使用 [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/w3c/clreq/issues) 提出中文支持的问题、讨论以及对有关文档的反馈。 学习[如何使用GitHub（英文）](https://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/guidelines/issues.html)。\n\n**You may raise issues in Chinese, however any substantive discussions should be summarised in English at some point, so that non-Chinese speakers can follow the rationale and contribute comments.**\n\n**您可以用中文提出问题，但任何实质性讨论都应该在某一阶段用英语进行总结，以便非汉语使用者理解该问题并发表意见。**\n\nGroup _members_ are expert contributors who participate actively in producing the work of the group, regularly contributing text and advice to create the outputs, and participating in meetings.

This is developed by the [ARIA Working Group](http://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/). The staff contact is [Michael Cooper](http://www.w3.org/People/cooper/). Please do not provide commit access to this repository without coordination.\n\n## Other Repositories\n\nThis repository is for the main deliverable of the ARIA Working Group, Accessible Rich Internet Applications. There are several other deliverables, such as ARIA modules, Accessibility API Mappings, and support documents. These are maintained in separate repositories listed on the [ARIA Contribution](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/contribute) page. Please file issues in the repository specific to the specification to which the issue applies.\n\n## Contributing to this Repository\n\n### Role of Editors\n\nOnly formally designated editors have commit access to this repository. Editors are designated by the Working Group Chair and make the following commitments:\n\n* Execute the consensus of the Working Group regardless of personal opinion;\n* Seek Working Group review of substantive technical issues;\n* In good faith separate editorial issues, which may be addressed without explicit review requests, from substantive issues which require review;\n* Follow the [W3C Manual of Style](http://www.w3.org/2001/06/manual/) and the [Chicago Manual of Style](http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/);\n* Follow [W3C Editors](http://www.w3.org/2003/Editors/) guidelines.\n\n### Non-Editor Contributions\n\nWorking Group participants and members of the public without commit privileges may contribute to this repository in the following ways:\n\n* Raise [issues](issues).\n* Submit [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).\n\nIssues can be assigned to people who are members of the [ARIA Contributors](https://github.com/orgs/w3c/teams/aria-contributors) team. Editors can add people to this team.\n\nWhen preparing GitHub pull requests:\n\n* Provide a complete summary and description for each pull request. The Working Group needs to understand the rationale for proposed changes. This description may need to be very detailed in some cases, or may be quite brief, for example if providing a change to address a spelling issue.\n* Keep pull requests specific to individual comments. Some comments may require changes to multiple source files, for example if an external link is incorrect in multiple files, and this is appropriate if the changes all relate to the same comment. However, if several separate comments are submitted together within a single pull request,  it is more difficult for the working group to parse the different points made in the comment and unless the group agrees with all aspects of the comment the pull request may need to be rejected.\n* Whenever possible, please create a separate pull request for each specification you are modifying. Doing so allows each specification editor to incorporate your contributions without having to check with the editors of the other documents you are modifying or to perform multiple manual merges.\n* Following the editorial documentation below will help prepare a pull request that is ready for inclusion with minimal editing.\n\nWhen a pull request is accepted by the Working Group, an editor will integrate changes. Pull requests and issues that are accepted by the working group will be merged into the source documents and the commenter will receive a notification from GitHub that the pull request was accepted.\n\n## Editorial Documentation\n\nDocuments in this repository use the [Respec](http://www.w3.org/respec/) preprocessor.\n\n### Special Elements and Classes\n\n#### Role, State, and Property References\n\nThe ARIA spec allows easy generation of links to roles, states, and properties, with the right link and styling. Simply enclose the name of the role, state, or property in the following elements:\n\n* `<rref>` for roles\n* `<sref>` for states\n* `<pref>` for properties\n\nNote: this only works in the ARIA spec. Other specs must use cross references as defined below.\n\n#### References to Other ARIA Specs\n\nLinks with special class attributes allow cross references into other specs in the suite, which are transformed by the script to be the appropriate target for the given publication, so editors' drafts point to other editors' drafts, and TR publications point to other TR publications. This requires some configuration options in the respecConfig and use of special class attributes.\n\nFirst, for each document that might be referenced, a set of URLs is provided. The URLs are indexed by values of the [respec spec status](http://www.w3.org/respec/ref.html#specstatus), which ensures the target at the same level of maturity as the current version is used. A typical set of values for the main ARIA spec is:\n\n```js\n// Spec URLs\nariaSpecURLs: {\n  \"FPWD\": \"http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/\",\n  \"ED\": \"http://w3c.github.io/aria/aria/aria.html\",\n  \"WD\" : \"http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/\",\n  \"REC\": \"http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/\"\n},\n```\n\nNote that even though some of these URIs are redundant, they must all be defined to work in all circumstances. If a document is a First Public Working Draft but the FPWD variant isn't defined, there won't be a match with the `specStatus` and the links won't work.\n\nThe following properties for cross references are currently available *(todo: we should add versions for the other docs)*:\n\n* `ariaSpecURLs`: for the main ARIA spec\n* `coreMappingURLs`: for the Core AAM\n* `accNameURLs`: for the AccName AAM\n* `htmlMappingURLs`: for the HTML AAM\n\nThe task of fixing up links is done by a script that needs to be hooked in via the following line in the respecConfig:\n\n```js\npreProcess: [ linkCrossReferences ]\n```\n\nOnce all this is defined in the `respecConfig`, use the `class` attribute on the links to activate the script for that link. The value of the `href` should be the fragment you want to target, i.e,. the hash tag and fragment ID. For example, a link to the list of roles in the ARIA spec would be:\n\n```html\n<a href=\"#role_definitions\" class=\"specref\">ARIA roles</a>\n```\n\nIf you want to target the main spec, leave the href blank (but present). If you want other classes on the link, e.g., for styling, provide them after the script-hooking class, for instance `class=\"specref role-reference\"`.\n\nThe set of class values currently defined are:\n\n* `role-reference`: role definitions\n* `state-reference`: state definitions\n* `property-reference`: property definitions\n* `specref`: other targets in the main ARIA spec\n* `core-mapping`: the Core AAM\n* `html-mapping`: the HTML AAM\n* `accname`: the AccName AAM\n\n*Todo: we should add versions for the other docs*\n\n### Shared Resources\n\nThe ARIA repositories share a common set of resources to reduce redundancy. Shared resources are in the [aria-common](https://github.com/w3c/aria-common/) repository, and copied to a \"common\" folder in this and other ARIA repositories. *It is important to make edits in the aria-common repository*; making edits in the common folder of another repository will allow the edits to be overridden.\n\n### Special Structures\n\nTodo: special characteristics table classes etc. used by the script\n\n### Editors' Drafts\n\nOfficial editors' drafts are published to  [https://w3c.github.io/aria/]. This URI is suitable for public references. Documents published to that location are *static* snapshots from the Respec processor. This is to minimize load time for consumers of these drafts. Editors' drafts are automatically updated (if there are no errors) by a [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/) service run when commits are pushed to the master branch.\n\n### How ARIA Extension Specs are Built\n\nAn extension spec is one that defines additional roles, states, and / or properties that augment\nthe collection defined in the core ARIA specification (aria/aria.html).  Extension specs must be\nbuilt in conjunction with the W3C ARIA WG if any new roles are to be in the default vocabulary space\n(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml/vocab).\n\nWhen building an extension spec, use the boiler plate provided in aria/template.html as a basis.  \n\nNote that this template uses the aria/script/ariaChild.js script.  That script knows how to incorporate\ninformation from the core ARIA specification into the extension spec so that new roles, states, and properties\nare well integrated into the overall ARIA taxonomy.\n\nThe ariaChild.js script relies upon an input script (aria/script/roleInfo.js).  As of today, that file is not automatically generated.\nIf you want to ensure the file is up to date, access the core ARIA spec with the special query string \"#saveRoles\"\nfrom a browser on a client that has write access to the copy of the extension spec you are editing. When the dialog appears, click\nthe save button and tell your browser to save the roleInfo.js file into the aria/script directory.\n\nThe scripts to support extension modules are stored in the aria-common repository. Therefore, updates to roleInfo.js must be saved and committed to that repository, even though they are generated from content in this repository.\n\n### Style guidelines\n\n#### Document style\n\n* There should always be introductory content before starting subsections.\n* Sequences of steps use ordered lists, the first paragraph of which labels the step and is in a &lt;strong&gt;; subsequent block elements are the content for the step.\n* Preformatted examples should \"pretty-print\" the example to be less than 80 characters wide, and indent the code using 2 space characters per indent step. Wrap within an element tag with an extra indent. Use line break characters, not &lt;br/&gt; elements, for new lines. Add extra line spacing as useful. They use the class \"example\". Use the Code Sample Expander tool to assist with this.\n* Keyboard characters should be in kbd elements.\n    * Spell out keys such as \"control\", \"shift\", \"command\", \"option\", \"alt\", \"insert\", \"pageup\", \"enter\", etc.\n    * Use plus as delimiter for keys that are pressed together, e.g., control+v\n    * Use comma as delimiter for keys that are pressed in sequence, e.g., insert, m\n* Language elements should be in code elements.\n* The first reference in a section to a role or state should be linked to the role or state with the appropriate class. Subsequent references needn't be referenced, but may be in certain circumstances.\n* repeated links to aria features should just be in &lt;code&gt;, not in cross-reference links (just link first time)\n* Headings use title case.\n* \"step\" headings, the bold sentence at the start of a numbered list item in a list of steps, are sentence case and not marked as an actual hx element. They should summarize what the following paragraphs get into.\n* Subheadings: only use sub-headers (&lt;h{x+1}&gt; following &lt;hx&gt;) if there are at least two of them. If there isn't more than two sub-sections, it isn't a sub-section and should be integrated into the parent section.\n* Lists: only use lists of two or more items. If it's only one item, it isn't a list and should have a different semantic.\n* Terms like \"Web\" are capitalized when it's \"the Web\", but not when referring to \"web applications\". Same for \"internet, rich internet applications\".\n* Synopsize the meaning of abbreviations and glossary terms the first time they are used in a section.\n* Acronyms we don't expand (but wrap in &lt;abbr&gt; elements):\n    * API\n* Acronyms we do expand (don't use the acronym)\n    * RIA (use rich internet application)\n    * AT (use assistive technology)\n* Cross reference links don't include section numbers.\n* Refer to states and properties in prose as \"attributes\", not as \"states\" or \"properties\" in order to be less confusing. (though they're still formally states or properties)\n\n#### Preferred terminology\n\n* When referring to an instance of a role, use \"element with a role of X\", not \"X role\" or \"X element\". \"X role\" refers to role in the taxonomy itself; \"X element\" is not technically meaningful.\n* \"Ajax\" is not spelled \"AJAX\"\n* \"Assistive technologies\" is plural, not singular.\n* Use \"WAI-ARIA\" instead of \"ARIA\", to avoid trademark confusion.\n* Use \"text alternative\" instead of \"text equivalent\" or the like, for consistency with WCAG 2.0 usage.\n* Reference \"DOMClick\" instead of \"DOMActivate\" which is going to be deprecated or made optional.\n\n#### Specification rules\n\n* Descendants of the composite role MUST NOT have the \"nameFrom\" value of \"contents\" set.\n* The composite role and its descendants MUST NOT have a childrenArePresentational value of \"true\".\n\n### Quality Assurance Checklist\n\nIn general, but particularly when preparing documents for TR publication, editors should check the following quality points:\n\n* Editor / author credits\n* [Participant credits](common/acknowledgements.html)\n* Documents are [valid HTML 5](http://validator.w3.org/)\n* Documents use the [HTML Polyglot](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-polyglot/) syntax to allow XML-based tools to process them and help catch errors caused by markup ambiguities.\n* Documents do not have [broken links or unnecessary redirects](http://validator.w3.org/checklink)\n* Spelling / typos\n* Consistent use of approved spellings when multiple are possible\n\n### Semi-Automated Sanity Checking\n\nThere was some automated sanity checking available, previously run by XSLT. This feature may be restored. The sanity check report helped determine the following potential issues:\n\n* When inheritance of roles change, the states they support may change. The tools will indicate when there is a change of supported states by comparison to an earlier version of the spec. It is a manual decision whether the changes are desired or if the set of supported states needs to be updated.\n* Ensure that supported state not defined if the state is also inherited\n* Check that the role spec and the UML Class Diagram express the same thing\n* Roles list only supported states that are defined\n* States indicate applicability only to roles that are defined\n* Roles and states cross reference each other: roles indicate supported states, and those states indicate applicability to those roles; discrepancies called out for manual attention\n",

Checkout the code\n 2. Run \"mvn clean compile\" to auto generate binding files\n 3. Open with IDE (e.g. Eclipse or IntelliJ)\n\n## Directory Layout\n\n * bin: executables\n * data: example data to work with (to help validating and discussing the ontologies)\n * generated: auto generated files based (e.g. documentation, graphical representation, other serializations)\n * import: related ontologies to be reused (second main focus)\n * ontologies: upper ontologies (to main focus)\n * queries: example queries to work with (to help validating and discussing the ontologies)\n * src: omnlib (Java implementation and tests)\n\n## Suggested Tools\n\n * [sparql](http://jena.apache.org/documentation/tools/) (command line tool from jena to query data)\n * [Protégé](http://protege.stanford.edu) (graphical ontology editor)\n * [Eclipse Xturtle](http://aksw.org/Projects/Xturtle.html) (text based ontology editor with code completion and simple validation)\n * [rdf.sh](https://github.com/seebi/rdf.sh) (command line ontology tools)\n * [OwlToUml](https://github.com/twalcari/OwlToUml) (to visualize simple ontologies as plantuml diagrams)\n * [rapper](http://librdf.org/raptor/rapper.html) (command line tool to convert and check ontologies)\n * [lodlive](http://en.lodlive.it) (user friendly vizualization of a sparql endpoint)\n * [yasgui](http://yasgui.laurensrietveld.nl) (user friendly query of a sparql endpoint)\n * [LODE](http://www.essepuntato.it/lode) (documentation generator for OWL files)\n\n## How To (rather old approach)\n\n### Run example Queries\n\n    ./bin/runQuery.sh\n\n### Example (pre defined): Get the published nodes\n\n    ./bin/runQuery.sh example2\n\n### Example (arbitrary): Get the status of the nodes for FLS\n\n    ./bin/runQuery.sh advertisement-fp getnodestatus\n",

There\nare quite a few of those in the [test results repository](https://github.com/w3c/test-results/).\n\nThe purpose of `wptreport` is to generate human-oriented reports for such data.\n\n## Installation\n\nThe typical installation is:\n\n    npm install wptreport\n\nIf you're hacking on the code, or want to be on the bleeding edge (which shouldn't be needed: I ship\nthe code pretty much anytime I make a change), you can alternatively\n\n    git clone https://github.com/darobin/wptreport.git\n    cd wptreport\n    npm link .\n\n## Usage\n\nThis is a command-line tool, it takes some basic options.\n\n`wptreport [--input /path/to/dir] [--output /path/to/dir] [--spec SpecName] [-f] [-m] [-d description]`\n\n* `--input <directory>`, `-i  <directory>`: Path to the directory that contains all the JSON data. \n  JSON files must match the pattern `\\w{2}\\d{d}\\.json` where the two first letters are an identifier \n  for the browser engine (use whatever makes sense to your audience) and the number is the version \n  number. Defaults to the current directory. This is also where the `filter.js` is found, if any \n  (see the section on filtering).\n* `--output <directory>`, `-o <directory>`: The directory where the generated reports are stored.\n  Defaults to the current directory.\n* `--spec SpecName`, `-s SpecName`: The specification name to use in titling the report. Optional, \n  but certainly looks nicer.\n* `--description DescFile`, `-d DescFile`: Include a description of report at the top.\n* `--failures`, `-f`: Include messages about failures in report.\n* `--markdown`, `-m`: Interpret subtest names as markdown.\n* `--help`, `-h`: Get some help (about the tool, you're on your own for your other issues).\n* `--version`, `-v`: Get the version number.\n\nIf there is a `wptreport.json` file in the input directory, options will be read from that file\n(but command line options will override those settings).\n\nThe format of the JSON files is defined by the test runner.\n\n## Filtering\n\nIf the input directory contains a `filter.js` file, it will be loaded as a Node module (and can \ntherefore completely operate like one). Some test suites have experimental tests, tests that can\nprovide useful information in some cases that you don't want in others, etc. As such, it can be \nuseful to filter out some results before reporting.\n\nThe module can optionally export two methods:\n\n* `excludeFile(fileName)`. Receives the name of the test *file* being looked at (as listed in the \n  JSON data). Return `true` to skip it (and therefore all of its content), `false` to keep it.\n* `excludeCase(fileName, caseName)`. Receives both the name of the test file and that of the test\n  case being looked at. Skip with `true`, keep with `false`. This is the same as the previous one,\n  only more granular.\n\n"

      "contributing": "# Contributing to Mobile Checker\n\nLooking to contribute to Mobile Checker? There is many ways to get involved in its developement. \nPlease take few minutes to read this document to understand how you can help in Mobile Checker developement.\n\n## Add a new check\n\nIt is pretty simple to add a new check to the mobile checker. Create a new check require only an experience in a client side JavaScript developement.\n\nA new check is composed by 2 composants:\n* the script itself, who will be executed on the tested web page.\n* the issue template, sent to the user.\n* testing.\n\n### script\nAll check scripts are located in the [lib/checks](https://github.com/w3c/Mobile-Checker/tree/master/lib/checks) directory. You just have to add your own script file in the correct category. Of course, feel free to create a new category if no category match with your check. Ready? Let's create your first check!\n\nThis is the basic template of check file. Save it in the lib directory:\n\n````javascript\nvar self = this;\nexports.name = \"name-of-the-check\"; //write here the name of your check. Have to match with the file's name.\nexports.category = \"name-of-the-category\"; //write here the name. Have to match with a category's directory name.\nexports.check = function(checker, browser) {\n\t/*\n\t * here your code.\n\t */\n};\n```\n\nThe ```check(checker, browser)``` function, receive ```checker``` and ```browser``` as parameters.\n* Use ```browser``` to test the web page.\n* Use ```checker``` to report the result.\n\nN.B: The ```browser``` object is based on the [mobile-web-browser-emulator API](https://github.com/w3c/mobile-web-browser-emulator) which is based on [selenium WebDriverJS API](https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/WebDriverJs). That allow you to use all the functions provided by these APIs.\n\n\n#### access to mobile-web-browser-emulator API: \n````javascript\nexports.check = function(checker, browser) {\n\t// get a browser object which can be use with mobile-web-browser-emulator API\n};\n```\nexample: \n````javascript\nexports.check = function(checker, browser) {\n\tbrowser.takeScreenshot(__dirname + \"/../screenshot.png\"); //mobile-web-browser-emulator method\n};\n```\n\n#### access to selenium WebDriverJS API: \n````javascript\n\tbrowser.do(function(driver) { //take a function in parameter\n\t\t// get a driver object which can be use with selenium webdriver \n\t}); \n```\nexample:\n````javascript\nexports.check = function(checker, browser) {\n\tbrowser.do(function(driver) {\n\t\tdriver.getTitle().then(function(title) { //selenium webdriver method\n\t\t\tconsole.log(title);\n\t\t});\n\t});\n};\n```\nN.B: WebDriverJS uses \"promises\" to track the state of each operation. [learn more](https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/WebDriverJs#Promises).\n\n#### run your own script:\n````javascript\nexports.check = function(checker, browser) {\n\tbrowser.do(function(driver) {\n\t\treturn driver.executeScript(function() {\n\t\t\t//write your own script and return what you need.\n        });\n\t});\n};\n```\n\n#### report a result:\nto report a result, use the report function of the checker object.\n````javascript\nchecker.report(key, name, category, status, data)\n```\n* **key**: name of the file issue to display in the report\n* **name**:\tself.name\n* **category**: self.category\n* **status**: error, warning or info\n* **data**: data to display in the issue reported (optional)\n\n\n### issue template\nAll check issues are located in the [lib/issues](https://github.com/w3c/Mobile-Checker/tree/master/lib/issues) directory. You just have to add your own issue file in the correct path as ```category/name-of-your-check/your-file```. You can create all issues you need. That allow you to use more than once the ```checker.report(key, name, category, status, data)``` function in your script.\n\nThe Mobile Checker use [EJS](http://www.embeddedjs.com/) to write the issues sent to the client side. That allow you to insert data in the reported issue.\n\ntemplate:\n````html\n<div class=\"col-md-12 issue\">\n    <div class=\"col-md-12 content-issue\">\n    \t<h2 class=\"title-issue page-header\">\n    \t\t<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></span> \n    \t\t<!-- title of your issue -->\n    \t\t<small><%=category%></small>\n    \t</h2>\n        <p> <!-- write here what's going on --> </p>\n        <p class='fixit'><strong>Fix it:</strong> <!-- explain here how to fix it --> </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n```\n",

Now join us, and make it grant your wishes. We hope you will make it awesome.\n\n## How does it work?\nThis tool is a full JavaScript Web application built with [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [Selenium WebDriver](http://docs.seleniumhq.org/projects/webdriver/). Based on the [mobile Web browser emulator API](https://github.com/w3c/mobile-web-browser-emulator), the Mobile Checker combines powerful technologies to simulate a Web browser on a mobile device.\nThat's why, contrary to most of the current online mobile emulators, the Mobile Checker can provide an emulation close to what your Web app looks like on different kinds of mobile devices, including tablets and smartphones.\n\n\n## Installation\nMobile Checker is a Node application. It will eventually be distributed through npm, but in the meantime\nyou can simply clone this repository:\n\n    git clone https://github.com/w3c/Mobile-Checker.git\n\n1. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)\n\n2. Install npm dependencies:\n\n    ```\n    npm install -d\n    ```\n\n3. In addition to the npm dependencies, install:\n\n* [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)\n* [browsermob-proxy](https://github.com/lightbody/browsermob-proxy/) running on port 8080\n* [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/)\n* [XVFB](http://www.x.org/archive/X11R7.6/doc/man/man1/Xvfb.1.xhtml)\n\n## Running\nIn your terminal, run:\n\n    node app.js\n\nThen, connect on the localhost:3000 port.\n\n## Testing\nTesting is done using mocha. Simply run:\n\n    mocha --timeout 30000\n\nfrom the root and you will be running the test suite. Mocha can be installed with:\n\n    npm install -g mocha\n\n## Feedback and contributions\n\n* **Send feedback** about the tool and join us on the [mailing list](public-qa-dev@w3.org).\n* **Discuss** about the Mobile Checker in our [Gitter room](https://gitter.im/w3c/Mobile-Checker).\n* **Report a bug** and open an issue on [Github](https://github.com/w3c/Mobile-Checker/issues).\n* **Send a feature request** on [Github](https://github.com/w3c/Mobile-Checker/issues).\n* **Contribute** to the Mobile Checker by first reading the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/w3c/Mobile-Checker/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n",

The Report\nTool runs entirely on the client and so it can be used offline\nand in any server configuration available to you.\n\nThe Report Tool does not save files to a server or in local\nstorage. Rather, load and save functions are available for\nstoring an evaluation to your local file system.\n\nImportant references:\n\n- <http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/>\n- <http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/>\n- <http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG-EM/>\n\nThe official released version of the Report Tool can be found at <http://www.w3.org/WAI/eval/report-tool/>. An example of the latest (unapproved by EO) version is available at <http://w3c.github.io/wcag-em-report-tool/dist/>.\n\nSee [Change log](changelog.md) for details about the latest version of the WCAG-EM Report Tool.\n\n\n# Requirements\n\nBefore you can install the WCAG-EM Report Tool you will need\nto install a few components:\n\n- NodeJS https://nodejs.org/en/ (or [NodeJS with Node Version Manager installed](https://github.com/creationix/nvm))\n\n  Minimum NodeJS version \"lts/carbon\" (Long term support)\n\n- Ruby   https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/\n\n  Latest stable version\n\n\n# Install\n\nInstall the _wcag em report tool_ by running:\n\n```bash\n# Choose a root folder to install this project then:\n\n# 1\ngit clone https://github.com/w3c/wcag-em-report-tool.git\n\n# 2\ncd wcag-em-report-tool\n\n# (Optional) if node installed with nvm\nnvm install\n\n# 3\nnpm install\n```\n\nThis will fetch the project, install all node packages, bower components and compass. See `scripts: install` in `package.json` for detailed installation info.\n\n\n# Usage\nYou can launch a development version by running:\n\n    npm start\n\nTo create a build in the /dist folder run:\n\n    npm run build\n\nThe build version can be hosted in on any server that available\non http(s). WCAG-EM Report Tool runs in your local browser, so it only loads static files from the server.\n\n\n# Translations\nThe WCAG-EM Report Tool aims to be available for a wide audience.\nMuch effort has been put into making translations as easy as\npossible. To learn about how to create your own translations\nread the [translation documentation](docs/translation.md)\n\n\n# Get Involved\nDid you find a bug, or are you interested in working with us to\ncreate new features for the Report Tool, then\n[get involved with the project](docs/contribute.md)!\n\n# Data Format\nData in the WCAG-EM Report Tool is saved and can again be loaded\nin a JSON format. The data format is\n[JSON Linked Data](http://json-ld.org/), and uses\n[EARL](http://www.w3.org/TR/EARL10-Schema/) to store the test\nresults.\n\nCustom fields are based on WCAG-EM and are documented in\n[EARL+JSON-LD format definition](docs/EARL+JSON-LD.md).\n",

      "readme": "# WAI Accessibility Evaluation Tools\n\n## Setup and Addition of Data\n\nData is collected in the `data` directory. There are two possibilities to use it.\n\n### (A) Local setup & GitHub Pages \n\nClone the repository to your hard disk and run\n\n~~~bash\n$ npm install\n~~~\n\nto initialize the repository and install all dependencies, like grunt. To use the data files with github pages, the files need to be compiled to one `data.js` files using the gulp script. Run\n\n~~~bash\n$ gulp watch\n~~~\n\nand add/edit the data files. The `data.json` file is automatically created.\n\n### (B) Server setup & PHP\n\nIf you want the script to pick up files on the (PHP enabled) server automatically once they are saved into the data directory, do all steps in (A) but after running `gulp watch` edit the `javascript/script.js` file. Search for `data.json` and replace it with `data.json.php`. After you save that file a new `js/master.min.js` is created that is using this path. Now you can upload the files to the server, **whenever you upload a new file to the `data` directory it will be picked up by the tool automagically**.\n\n### Appendix: Data format\n\nUsually data should be entered and edited using the submission form to ensure valid JSON. The data is collected in JSON files with each entry in the following format:\n\n~~~json\n{\n  \"title\": \"<string>\",\n  \"creator\": \"<string>\",\n  \"location\": \"<url>\",\n  \"release\": \"<date format='YYYY-MM-DD'>\",\n  \"version\": \"<string>\",\n  \"description\": \"<string>\",\n  \"language\": [\"<array of strings>\"],\n  \"guideline\": [\"<array of strings>\"],\n  \"assists\": [\"<array of strings>\"],\n  \"automated\": [\"<array of strings>\"],\n  \"repairs\": [\"<array of strings>\"],\n  \"technology\": [\"<array of strings>\"],\n  \"onlineservice\": [\"<array of strings>\"],\n  \"desktopapp\": [\"<array of strings>\"],\n  \"authoringtools\": [\"<array of strings>\"],\n  \"browsers\": [\"<array of strings>\"],\n  \"reports\": [\"<array of strings>\"],\n  \"license\": [\"<array of strings>\"],\n  \"update\": [\"<array of strings>\"],\n  \"type\": [\"<array of strings>\"]\n}\n~~~\n\n`title`, `creator`, `url`, `release`, `version` and `desc` can have only one (string) value. All other fields can either be one or multiple values. If a tool has multiple values, like different languages, enclose them with square brackets and separate them with a comma. If only one value is used, the brackets are optional. (a value of \"English\" is equivalent to [\"English\"]).\n\n Due to limitations of the tool, the values have to be the same throughout the whole data set, for example “Freeware” and “FreeWare” would be considered two different strings to filter by. This is really important for the more complex things like “WCAG 2: Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2” or similar.\n \n## Listing Form Configuration\n \nThe form content can easily be edited using the `config.php` file in root. It looks like this:\n \n~~~php\n<?php\ndate_default_timezone_set('UTC'); // Sets time zone, allows us to format dates from strings.\n$demo = false; // If demo mode is true, data isn’t sent to the list.\n\n$assists = array(\n\ttitle => \"Assists evaluations by:\", // Fieldset heading\n\tdata => array( // Options, format: \"shortname_no_spaces\" => \"longname\"\n\t\t\"report\" => 'Generating reports of evaluation results', \n\t\t\"wizard\" => 'Providing step-by-step evaluation guidance',\n\t\t\"inpage\" => 'Displaying information within web pages',\n\t\t\"transformation\" => 'Modifying the presentation of web pages'\n\t),\n\tother => false, // If true, a other field is displayed\n\tvariable => 'assists', // An identifier, usually the same as the variable name\n\ttype => 'checkbox', // or 'radio'\n\texplanation => array( // If items need explanations, provide it in the format \"shortname\" => \"URI\"\n\t\t\"report\" => 'http://www.w3.org/WAI/eval/selectingtools.html#reports',\n\t\t\"wizard\" => 'http://www.w3.org/WAI/eval/selectingtools.html#wizards',\n\t\t\"inpage\" => 'http://www.w3.org/WAI/eval/selectingtools.html#in-page',\n\t\t\"transformation\" => 'http://www.w3.org/WAI/eval/selectingtools.html#transformation'\n\t)\n);\n\n/* multiple other of those blocks for configuration */\n~~~\n\n### Adding a new block\n\n1. Enter block data as noted above.\n\n2. In `submission.php`: \n\nAround line `100`, enter a line like the following: \n\n~~~php\n$data->assists = iter($_POST['assists'], $assists);\n~~~\n \nAround line `370`, enter a line like the following:\n  \n~~~php\n<?php create_form_cb_section($assists); ?>\n~~~\n\n### Exposing as filters\n\nTo expose a new category as filters, set the repository up for local editing and run `grunt watch` as described in (A) above. Then edit the `javascript/script.js` file. Under `var settings = {` you can find a few configuration options which are taken from the `facetedsearch.js` javascript library (see [bottom of this page for an example](https://eikes.github.io/facetedsearch/)). But there have been some changes to the configuration for facets:\n\n~~~js\nfacets: {\n\t'guideline' : {\n\t\t'title': 'Guidelines', \n\t\t'promoted': [\n\t\t\t\"<strong><abbr title=\\\"Web Content Accessibility Guidelines\\\">WCAG<\\/abbr> 2.0 — <abbr title=\\\"World Wide Web Consortium\\\">W3C<\\/abbr> Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0<\\/strong>\", \n\t\t\t\"<abbr title=\\\"Web Content Accessibility Guidelines\\\">WCAG<\\/abbr> 1.0 — <abbr title=\\\"World Wide Web Consortium\\\">W3C<\\/abbr> Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0\"\n\t\t]\n\t},\n\t'language'  : {\n\t\t'title': 'Languages', \n\t\t'collapsed': true\n\t},\n\t'a11yinfo' : {\n\t\t'title': 'Accessibility Statement', \n\t\t'plain': true \n\t}\n\t[…more facets…]\n},\n~~~\n\nEvery facet has a `title`, which is mandatory. It is the `<summary>` of the `<details>` element. If the facet should be collapsed by default, set `'collapsed': true`. If there should be no `<details>` & `<summary>` around that item, set `'plain': true`.\n\n",

Please follow them and we will be able to review your PR a lot faster when we don't have to point out style and other non-technical issues. Thank you.\n\n### W3C Legal\nContributions to this repository are intended to become part of Recommendation-track documents governed by the\n[W3C Patent Policy](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy-20040205/) and\n[Document License](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/copyright-documents). To bring substantive contributions to specifications, you must either participate\nin the relevant W3C Working Group or make a non-member patent licensing commitment.\n\nIf you are not the sole contributor to a contribution (pull request), please identify all contributors in the \ncommit message. In the commit, please include on a new line,\n<pre>Contributors: +@githubusername1, +@githubusername2, ...</pre>\n\n### Line Wrapping\n\n#### Recommendations\nFormat new text to break each line within 80 characters. If you add a few new words to an existing paragraph, it's OK if that line exceeds 80 characters. If fixing the width means that the next line gets to wide, and so on, it's better to leave it since touching a lot of lines unrelated to the actual fix makes the PR harder to review. We will make automatic re-flows of the document every once in a while.\n\n#### Automatic Formatting\nYou can use [webrtc-respec-ci](https://github.com/w3c/webrtc-respec-ci) to automatically format your code. Note that this script formats the entire document and may change lines that are not part of your original patch. This can make your changes harder to review.\n\n1. Follow the instructions on \"Local use\" to setup the scripts.\n2. Run: ```make -f ../webrtc-respec-ci/Makefile linewrap LINEWRAPLENGTH=80```.\n\n### Pull Request Names\nChoose a name for your PR that would make sense in a change log.  \nExample: Add support for new attribute X on Y (fixes: #123).  \nAvoid: Fix for #123.\n\n### Linked Names\nMake names of interfaces, enums and other identifiers clickable like this ```<code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code>```.\n\n### Refactoring: Moving Text\nIf your PR needs to both move a section of text and update it, please do these operations in two separate commits (or even PRs). That will make the review process simpler.\n\n### Run Linter on Examples\nIf you have made a lot of changes to the example code snippets it might be a good idea to run the example linter. For instructions, see https://github.com/w3c/webrtc-respec-ci/blob/master/check-examples/README.md\n",

To bring substantive contributions to specifications, you must either participate\nin the relevant W3C Working Group or make a non-member patent licensing commitment.\n\nIf you are not the sole contributor to a contribution (pull request), please identify all contributors in the \ncommit message. In the commit, please include on a new line,\n<pre>Contributors: +@githubusername1, +@githubusername2, ...</pre>\n\n### 80 Characters\nFormat new text to break each line within 80 characters. If you add a few new words to an existing paragraph, it's OK if that line exceeds 80 characters. If fixing the width means that the next line gets to wide, and so on, it's better to leave it since touching a lot of lines unrelated to the actual fix makes the PR harder to review. We will make automatic re-flows of the document every once in a while.\n\n### Pull Request Names\nChoose a name for your PR that would make sense in a change log.  \nExample: Add support for new attribute X on Y (fixes: #123).  \nAvoid: Fix for #123.\n\n### Linked Names\nMake names of interfaces, enums and other identifiers clickable like this ```<code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code>```.\n\n### JSEP References\nReference specific sections of JSEP where possible. The syntax looks like this:  \n```<span data-jsep=\"initial-offers initial-answers\">[[!JSEP]]</span>```  \nSection aliases, to be used as data-jsep values, are found in [jsep-mapping/map.json](jsep-mapping/map.json). Information on how to update the map is found in [jsep-mapping/README.md](jsep-mapping/README.md).\n\n### Refactoring: Moving Text\nIf your PR needs to both move a section of text and update it, please do these operations in two separate commits (or even PRs). That will make the review process simpler.\n\n### Run Linter on Examples\nIf you have made a lot of changes to the example code snippets it might be a good idea to run the example linter. For instructions, see https://github.com/w3c/webrtc-respec-ci/blob/master/check-examples/README.md\n\n### Style Conventions\n\n**Strings**. Use quotes and enclose in code tags (to distinguish strings literals from quoted prose).\nExample: `<code>\"String literal\"</code>`\n\n**Booleans**. Enclose booleans in code tags (without quotes).\\\nExample: `<code>true</code>`\n\n**Enum Values**. See **Strings**.\n\n**Notes**. Use div tags for notes.\\\nExample: `<div class='note'>FYI</div>`\n\n**Internal Slots**. Use upper camel case (initial upper case letter) with a leading backslash and enclosed by two brackets. The leading backslash prevents the text in double brackets from being interpreted as a reference. If a slot name is very general, like \"Id\", it might be useful to add more information to it to avoid name collisions and make it easier to identify its owning entity. For example, \"Id\" could be extended to \"ComponentId\".\\\nExample (defining): `<dfn>[[\\FooBar]]</dfn>`\\\nExample (referencing): `<a>[[\\FooBar]]</a>`\n\n### Tests\nFor normative changes, a corresponding [web-platform-tests](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt) PR is highly appreciated. Typically, both PRs will be merged at the same time. Note that a test change that contradicts the spec should not be merged before the corresponding spec change. If testing is not practical, please explain why and if appropriate [file a web-platform-tests issue](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/issues/new) to follow up later. Add the `type:untestable` or `type:missing-coverage` label as appropriate.\n",

This Promise will resolve to an object containing:\n\n- **resolved url** `String`\n- **status** (true if well formed, else false) `Boolean`\n- **error report** `Array`\n\nor rejects with the unexpected errors the checker encountered when checking the URL\n\nExample:\n\n```javascript\nvar insafe = require('insafe');\n\ninsafe.check({\n\turl: 'example.com'\n}).then(function (res) {\n  if(res.status == false) {\n  console.log('not valid url: ' +res.url);\n  } else {\n  console.log('The URL is valid.');\n  }\n}).catch(console.log);\n```\n\nSeveral options are available to check the URL:\n\n- **url** (required): a `String`.\n- **statusCodesAccepted**: an `Array` of accepted HTTP(S) status codes. See the [default config](https://github.com/w3c/insafe/blob/master/lib/insafe.js).\n- **statusCodesRefused**: an `Array` of refused HTTP(S) status codes. See the [default config](https://github.com/w3c/insafe/blob/master/lib/insafe.js).\n- **blacklist**: an `Array` of blacklisted hosts.\n- **whitelist**: an `Array` of whitelisted hosts.\n\nExample:\n\n```javascript\nvar insafe = require('insafe');\n\ninsafe.check({\n    url: 'http://www.w3.org/',\n    statusCodesAccepted: [\"404\"],\n    statusCodesRefused: [\"301\", \"203\"],\n    blacklist: ['h4ck3rz.org'],\n    whitelist: ['www.w3.org', 'example.com']\n}).then(function (res) {\n  if(res.status == false) {\n  console.log('not valid url: ' +res.url);\n  } else {\n  console.log('The URL is valid.');\n  }\n}).catch(console.log);\n```\n",

This module also allows manipulation via Selenium WebDriver. It is an easy way to test mobile web applications on mobile devices.\n\nThis module is used by the new version of the [Mobile Checker by W3C](https://validator.w3.org/mobile-alpha/).\n\nThis application works in [headless](https://github.com/kesla/node-headless) mode (powered via XVFB). Using it on the server side is easy.\n\n![alt google screenshot](https://github.com/guibbs/mobile-web-browser-emulator/blob/master/examples/screenshots/google.png)\n![alt w3c screenshot](https://github.com/guibbs/mobile-web-browser-emulator/blob/master/examples/screenshots/w3.png)\n\n## Install\n\nStart by having [BrowserMob Proxy](http://bmp.lightbody.net/) set up and running. Then run the following command\n\n```\nnpm install mobile-web-browser-emulator\n```\n\n## API\n\nWith Mobile Web Browser Emulator, it is easy test mobile web applications [using the Selenium WebDriver API](http://selenium.googlecode.com/git/docs/api/javascript/index.html).\n\nEmulation example:\n\n```javascript\nvar MobileBrowser = require('mobile-web-browser-emulator').MobileBrowser;\nvar mobileBrowser = new MobileBrowser();\n\nmobileBrowser.emulate(\n  // Parameters such as dimensions for tablets, smartphones or desktops.\n  {\n    url: 'https://www.google.com/', // URL to load. **required**\n    width: 300, // Width of the device. **optional** (300 by default)\n    height: 700 // Height of the device. **optional** (300 by default)\n  },\n\t// The second parameter is a callback that takes a browser instance as an argument\n\tfunction(browser) { /* ... */ }\n);\n```\n\nMethods on the `browser` object:\n\n```javascript\nbrowser.do(function(driver) {\n  // The driver object can then be used with Selenium WebDriver\n});\nbrowser.takeScreenshot('example.png');\n```\n\nManipulation with Selenium example :\n\n```javascript\nvar MobileBrowser = require('../lib/index.js').MobileBrowser;\nvar mobileBrowser = new MobileBrowser();\n\nmobileBrowser.emulate({\n  url: 'https://www.google.com',\n  width: 300,\n  height: 700\n}, function(browser) {\n  browser.do(function(driver) {\n    driver.getTitle().then(function(title) { // Selenium Webdriver Method\n      console.log(title);\n    });\n  });\n});\n```\n\nScreenshot example:\n\n```javascript\nvar MobileBrowser = require('../lib/index.js').MobileBrowser;\nvar mobileBrowser = new MobileBrowser();\n\nmobileBrowser.emulate({\n  url: 'https://www.google.com',\n  width: 300,\n  height: 700\n}, function(browser) {\n  browser.takeScreenshot(__dirname + \"/../screenshot.png\");\n});\n```\n\n## Licence\n\nCopyright (c) 2014 Dominique Hazael Massieux, Guillaume Baudusseau\n\nMIT\n",

      "readme": "# Unicorn\n\nUnicorn is W3C's unified validator, which helps people improve the quality of their Web pages by performing a variety of checks. Unicorn gathers the results of the popular HTML and CSS validators, as well as other useful services.\n\nThis site addresses these audiences:\n\n* Users, those who want to check their Web pages and understand how to fix them based on Unicorn results.\n* Developers, those who wish to add new services, work on existing services, or help develop the underlying Unicorn framework.\n* Server Managers, those who wish to run their own Unicorn service locally. \n\n## How to compile and deploy Unicorn:\n\n###### 1. The first thing you have to do in order to make Unicorn work is to add a `unicorn.home` parameter to your JVM parameters, pointing to the unicorn root directory.\n\nexample : \n\n`Dunicorn.home=/var/lib/tomcat6/webapps/unicorn/` or `Dunicorn.home=/C:/Program%20Files/Tomcat/webapps/unicorn/` (read your servlet engine documentation to know how to add this parameter)\n\n\n###### 2. You will find all the configuration files that Unicorn uses in `WEB-INF/conf`.\n\n* The main one is `unicorn properties`, which contains some properties that you may want to change:\n\t* `UNICORN_URL` is the URL of your installation of Unicorn.\n\t* `DEFAULT_LANGUAGE`, the language Unicorn will use if language negotiation fails.\n\t* You can nest properties in this file, meaning that Unicorn will replace any ${<Property_key>} by its value.\n\t* There is one property that is not specify in the file but added at runtime, `UNICORN_HOME`, which is equal to the JVM parameter `unicorn.home`.\n* `velocity.properties` contains properties for the template engine that Unicorn uses: Apache Velocity\n\t* By default template caching is set to false. In a production environment you should set this property to true.\n\t* `parser.pool.size` is set to the default velocity value (20). If you have a lot of requests you may have to increase this value. In any case check the logs to see if you need to change it (Velocity will log warnings).\n* `log4j.properties` is the properties file for Apache Log4j. The property `UNICORN_HOME` is also available in this file. By default logs will be written in `WEB-INF/logs` and sorted by package and level.\n\t* If you are developing Unicorn locally you should add the appender GUI to the root logger. This will pop up a useful LogFactor5 console.\n\t* You can find documentation about log4j configuration here: http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/manual.html\n\t* Note that log4j is not mandatory for Unicorn to work properly. If log4j.properties does not exist the default `java.util.Logger` will be used.\n* observers.list is the list of the observers contract links\n\n\n###### 3. Under `WEB-INF/resources/tasklist` you will find the task related files which are xml files describing tasks and rdf files containing metadata about tasks.\n\n\n###### 4. Use ant to compile the project. You can use the 'war' task to make a war file of the 'jar' task to package Unicorn in a jar. The files will be written in the dist directory. See `build.xml` for more info.\nex: `ant war`\n\n\n###### 5. As root, copy the file resources/tomcat_policy in the policy directory of tomcat (/etc/tomcat5/policy.d for Debian) and eventually edit it to fit your needs.\nNote that this file is very important because it will give permissions to read and write files under Unicorn servlet dir, but also to connect to distant hosts (observers).\n\n\n## How to initialize Unicorn:\n\nOnce you have compiled and deploy Unicorn on your engine you must initialize it. There are a few mandatory steps that Unicorn has to do before being usable, like parsing the contract files, language files, taklists, etc...\n\nIf your engine uses the `web.xml` description file (which should be the case with almost any servlet engine) initialization is automated at startup.\n\nIf you want to manually initialize Unicorn you can simply execute the InitAction by connecting to http://localhost:8080/unicorn/init. This task will launch all initialization tasks which are:\n* initialize Unicorn core\n* load Unicorn observers (you can execute this task only by connecting to /init?task=observers)\n* load Unicorn tasklists (/init?task=tasklist)\n* load language files (/init?task=language)\n\nIn a production environment InitAction servlet should be protected to be accessible only from localhost (set PROTECT_INIT_ACTION to true in unicorn.properties)\n\n## How does the log work:\n\nUnder Tomcat logs files are on `\"webapps/unicorn/WEB-INF/logs/\"`.\n\nThere are split in two directory :\n* \"level\" where log are split in one file by log level (trace, debug, info, warning and error).\n* \"package\" where log are split by package where they come from. There are also one file called \"all.log\" which contains all logs informations."

If\nyour employer(s) has rights to the intellectual property that you create that\nincludes your Contributions, you represent that you have received permission to\nmake Contributions on behalf of that employer and that your employer has waived\nsuch rights for your Contributions to W3C.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nAll content from this repository is provided as is, and W3C makes no\nrepresentations or warranties, express or implied, including, but not limited\nto, warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose,\nnon-infringement, or title; nor that the contents of this repository are\nsuitable for any purpose.\n\n***\n\n## Build tool\n\nThis website is [Jekyll][jekyll]. This transforms the source content\ninto a set of static HTML pages which can then be served using any\nwebserver.\n\n## Deployment in Production\n\nThe production copy of this website is located at\n[testthewebforward.org domain][testtwf-org]. It is hosted on\n[GitHub][github-io]. In order to build the static copy of the website,\na [travis][travis] script is run on each commit to the master branch. This\nperforms the build steps and pushes the result to a second repository\ncontaining only the output HTML and other assets.\n\n### Testing Changes Locally\n\nBuilding the tests locally requires [Ruby][ruby] and\n[Ruby Gems][gems]. These are installed by default on many systems; if\nthey are not present on your system they can be installed using your\npackage manager or via the installers downloadable on their websites.\n\nIf it not already installed the `bundler` program should then be\ninstalled using\n\n    $ gem install bundler\n\nThe dependencies can then be installed using the `bundle` command:\n\n    $ bundle install\n\nIf you are running Xcode 5.1 or over and get the following error when installing,\n\n    clang: error: unknown argument: '-multiply_definedsuppress' [-Wunused-command-line-argument-hard-error-in-future]\n\nthis is [a known issue][jekyll-clang-bug] and you will need to install jekyll\nwith the following command. (You may need to do this from a superuser shell.)\n\n    $ ARCHFLAGS=-Wno-error=unused-command-line-argument-hard-error-in-future gem install github-pages\n\nThis will also install `rake`, a `make`-like tool that defines a\nnumber of targets corresponding to useful operations. To start a local\nserver use `rake serve`\n\n    $ rake serve\n\nOnce this has finished building, navigate your browser to\n`http://localhost:4000` to see the site.\n\nModifications to the source code get automatically picked-up and\ndisplayed on page refresh.\n\n## Documentation format\n\nDocumentation should be written using [Markdown][markdown]. It will be\ntransformed into HTML during the build process.\n\nTo ease online review, lines should be no longer than 80 characters. This is\ngreatly simplified by using [reference style links][ref-style] placed at the\nbottom of the page. For example (lifted off John Gruber's\n[Markdown Syntax guide][markdown]):\n\n    This is [an example][eg] reference-style link.\n\n    [...]\n\n    Then, anywhere in the document (usually at the end), you define your link\n    label like this, on a line by itself:\n\n    [eg]: http://example.com/\n\nFavor named referenced over indexed ones, as those make refactoring much\nsimpler.\n\nAs an added benefit, this syntax makes keeping links up to date a\nlot easier as they are all placed together at the bottom of the page.\n\n## Blog post format\n\nBlog post should be written using either HTML or [Markdown][markdown]. In Jekyll,\nblog posts are just regular text files which get treated differently when\nfollowing a few simple conventions (mainly file names and directory structure)\nas described in the [online documentation][jekyll-blog].\n\nAll blog posts must be located in the `_posts` directory and must use the `post`\ntemplate (which should be specified in the [YAML front-matter][front-matter]).\n\nBlog posts can be of three different types. Regular, in depth posts should use the\n`post` type, shorter posts, the `quickpost` type, and `newsletter` posts… the\n`newsletter` type. Types are added using [YAML front-matter][front-matter].\n\nNote that posts of type `post` will have data pulled from the `people` database\nlocated in the [site-wide config file][config] in order to populate their \"about the\nauthor section\".\n\nAlso noteworthy is the ability to signal when posts have been cross-posted elsewhere.\nThis can be done using the `x-post` property in the [YAML front-matter][front-matter].\n\n## Event page format\n\nEvent pages should be written in HTML. A lot of the content is automatically\ngenerated from data placed in the [YAML front-matter][front-matter]. This\nincludes:\n\n* name of the city (`city`, and `localized_city` fields),\n* date of the event (`date`, and `localized_date` fields),\n* title of the page (optional `title` field),\n* list of event sponsors (`sponsors` field),\n* list of event speakers (`speakers` field), and\n* list of event experts (`experts` field).\n\nSetting the language of the page (`lang` field) can help automatically\nlocalize some of the above.\n\nThere are good examples of how to author this YAML front-matter in the\n[page for the Seattle event][event-eg].\n\nThe `sponsors`, `speakers` and `experts` field simply pull data out of the\n[site-wide config file][config] (a poor man's db) which they run through\n[templates][templates] to produce markup. So for example:\n\n``` yaml\n---\nlang: zho\nspeakers: [Rebecca Hauck]\n---\n```\n\nwill automatically create the following HTML markup:\n\n``` html\n<div class=\"speakers\">\n  <h2 id=\"speakers\">专家</h2>\n  <div class=\"media col-md-4\">\n    <img class=\"media-object thumbnail pull-left\" width=\"48\" height=\"48\"\n      src=\"/assets/experts/rhauck.jpg\" alt=\"Picture of Rebecca Hauck\">\n    <h4 class=\"media-heading\">Rebecca Hauck</h4>\n       <p>Adobe, CSS Working Group</p>\n    </li>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\nNote that while sponsors get automatically added to the end of the events page,\nspeakers and experts need to be included via an `include tag` at the desired\nlocation. E.g.:\n\n``` html\n<p>Some content goes here:</p>\n\n{% include events/speakers.html %}\n\n<p>All talks will be given in English.</p>\n\n{% include events/experts.html %}\n```\n\nShould you need to modify or add a speaker, expert or sponsor, please do so in\nthe [config file][config]. The format is [YAML][yaml] of which JSON is a\nsubset. Note that speakers and experts share the same `people` entry.\n\n## File names\n\nFile names should be lowercased, hyphenated and use the `.md` extension for\n[Markdown](markdown)-formated content (e.g.: `review-process.md`). The build\nstep will change these to `review-process.html` and use it as URL.\n\n## Contribution workflow\n\nContributions should follow the standard open source GitHub workflow (fork\nthe repository, work off topic-branches, send atomic commits as pull requests,\nand get them reviewed by a peer).\n\nGenerally, contributing to a doc will imply:\n\n1.  commenting on the issue to announce you're planning to work on it,\n2.  looking at [existing docs][resources] to find related content,\n3.  using an [online service][fuckyeahmarkdown] to convert that content to\n    [Markdown][markdown],\n4.  copyediting it,\n5.  adding [YAML front-matter][front-matter], and\n6.  sending a pull request.\n\nThanks for your help!\n\n[cc-by]: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\n[config]: https://github.com/w3c/testtwf-website/blob/gh-pages/_config.yml\n[front-matter]: http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/\n[event-eg]: https://github.com/w3c/testtwf-website/blob/gh-pages/events/2013/seattle.html#L1-L8\n[fuckyeahmarkdown]: http://fuckyeahmarkdown.com/\n[gems]: https://rubygems.org/\n[gh-pages]: http://pages.github.com/\n[github-io]: http://w3c.github.io/testtwf-website/\n[install-jekyll]: https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages\n[jekyll]: http://jekyllrb.com/\n[jekyll-blog]: http://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/\n[jekyll-clang-bug]: https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/2125\n[markdown]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax\n[ref-style]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#link\n[resources]: https://github.com/w3c/testtwf-website/blob/gh-pages/RESOURCES.md\n[ruby]: https://www.ruby-lang.org/\n[staging]: http://www.testthewebforward-staging.org/\n[templates]: https://github.com/w3c/testtwf-website/blob/gh-pages/_includes\n[travis]: https://travis-ci.org\n[testtwf-org]: http://testthewebforward.org\n[yaml]: http://www.yaml.org/\n",

It provides a platform- and language-neutral\nwire protocol as a way for out-of-process programs to remotely\ninstruct the behavior of web browsers.\n\nProvided is a set of interfaces to discover and manipulate DOM\nelements in web documents and to control the behavior of a user\nagent. It is primarily intended to allow web authors to write tests\nthat automate a user agent from a separate controlling process, but\nmay also be used in such a way as to allow in-browser scripts to\ncontrol a — possibly separate — browser.\n\nThe standard is authored by the W3C [Browser Testing- and Tools\nWorking Group], and has produced the following documents:\n\n  * **Living Document**: https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/\n  * **Candidate Recommendation** level 1: https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver1/\n\n[Browser Testing- and Tools Working Group]: https://www.w3.org/testing/browser/\n\n\nContribute\n----------\n\nIn short, change `index.html` and submit a pull request\n(PR) with a [good commit message].  Changes that affect behaviour\n_must_ be accompanied with corresponding test changes to the [Web\nPlatform Tests] repository.\n\nWe use [ReSpec] to help us maintain referential integrity,\nbibliographical data, and perform other mundane tasks such as\nstyling.  To preview your changes, just load `index.html` from disk\nin a browser.  To verify the integrity of the document you can run\n`make test`.\n\nFor more information about the interoperability of driver\nimplementations, see the [implementation report].\n\nYou may add your name to the [Acknowledgements] section in your\nfirst PR, even for trivial fixes.  The names are sorted lexicographically.\n\nSee [CONTRIBUTING.md] for more guidelines.\n\n[good commit message]: https://github.com/erlang/otp/wiki/Writing-good-commit-messages\n[implementation report]: ./ImplementationReport.md\n[Acknowledgements]: https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/#acknowledgements\n[Web Platform Tests]: https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/tree/master/webdriver\n[ReSpec]: https://github.com/w3c/respec/wiki\n[CONTRIBUTING.md]: ./CONTRIBUTING.md\n",

When used as a module, it must be given to the `check()` function as a [JavaScript object literal](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Grammar_and_types#Object_literals). In both cases, its format is the following:\n\n```\n{\n    \"domains\": [\n        \"www.foobar.org\"\n    ],\n    \"urls\": [\n        \"http://example.org/image.jpg\"\n    ]\n}\n```\n",

      "contributing": "# Contribute to Echidna\n\nThis is the contribution reference of Echidna. Great to have you here. Here are a few ways you can help make this project better!\n\n## Talk with us\n\nTalk with us directly on IRC. Here are some [detailed instructions to connect](http://www.w3.org/Project/IRC/). The server is `irc.w3.org` and the corresponding channel is `#pub`. If you do not have an IRC client on hand, you can log into the [W3C Public IRC Web Client](http://irc.w3.org/).\n\nDiscuss the publication workflow and related tools [on the mailing list](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/spec-prod/).\n\n## Report a bug or suggest a feature idea\n\nStart by looking through the [existing bugs](https://github.com/w3c/echidna/issues) to see if this was already discussed earlier. You might even find your solution there.\n\nRemember to update [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) often, and the npm dependencies of the project too.\n\nIf you do not find anything, you can help report bugs by [filing them here](https://github.com/w3c/echidna/issues/new). Please use the following template when doing so:\n\n```markdown\n##### Issue Type\n\nCan you help us out in labelling this by telling us what kind of ticket this this?\nYou can say \"Bug Report\", \"Feature Idea\" or \"Documentation Report\".\n\n##### Summary\n\nPlease summarize your request in this space. You will earn bonus points for being\nsuccinct, but please add enough detail so we can understand the request. Thanks!\n\n##### Steps To Reproduce\n\nIf this is a bug ticket, please enter the steps you use to reproduce the problem\nin the space below. If this is a feature request, please enter the steps you would\nuse to use the feature. If an example document is useful, please include its URL.\n\n##### Expected Results\n\nPlease enter your expected results in this space. When running the steps supplied\nabove in the previous section, what did you expect to happen? If showing example\noutput, please surround it with 3 backticks before and after so that it's rendered\ncorrectly.\n\n##### Actual Results\n\nPlease enter your actual results in this space. When running the steps supplied\nabove, what actually happened? If showing example output, please surround it with\n3 backticks before and after so that it's rendered correctly.\n```\n\n## Contribute to the code\n\nFirst of all, thank you very much for offering your help. This is much appreciated.\n\nBefore adding a new feature or submitting a bugfix, please refer to the [existing issues](https://github.com/w3c/echidna/issues) to check if it was already discussed before. If it wasn't, please [create a new one](https://github.com/w3c/echidna/issues/new) so that we can discuss together about it before you start coding. It would be frustrating for everyone if we had to refuse your contribution because we did not share the same opinion!\n\nTo make sure we are on the same page, you should refer to our [coding style guide](https://github.com/w3c/echidna/wiki/Coding-style-guide) and [coding practices guide](https://github.com/w3c/echidna/wiki/Coding-practices-guide) before coding.\n\nFinally, we value testing a lot. Before committing anything, make sure the style is respected and the test suite passes by running `npm test`. If you submit a bugfix, try to write tests to reproduce this bug to ensure the same bug will not come up again in the future. And if you submit a new feature, provide tests to ensure the correct behavior of the nominal and edge cases.\n\nA couple of things you should consider before committing and [opening a pull request](https://github.com/w3c/echidna/pulls):\n\n- Regarding your Git commit messages:\n  - Use imperative present tense for commit messages as [suggested in the official documentation](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Distributed-Git-Contributing-to-a-Project#Commit-Guidelines).\n  - When commiting a bug fix, start your line with \"Fix #xx\", xx being the issue number. For example: `git commit -m 'Fix #42: Answer the Ultimate Question of Life, The Universe, and Everything'`\n- To ease the merge of pull requests, make sure your branch is up-to-date with `master` when submitting it. Always use `git rebase` instead of `git merge` and `git pull --rebase` instead of `git pull` to avoid merge commits in your submissions.\n\n## Documentation\n\nDocumentation can be found on [the wiki](https://github.com/w3c/echidna/wiki). You can help us improving it by adding missing pieces, clarifying unclear parts, or asking us to do that.\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nAll contributors to this project agree to follow the [W3C Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/).\n\nIf you want to take action, you can contact W3C Staff as explained in [W3C Procedures](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/pwe/#Procedures).\n",

The plan is for Echidna and related sub-projects (see below) to automate the publication of new specs under <http://www.w3.org/TR/>.\n\n## Using Echidna as an editor\n\n**If you are a spec editor, you do not need to install Echidna, nor to run it locally.**\n\nPlease [see the wiki](https://github.com/w3c/echidna/wiki) for how to use Echidna as a spec editor.\n\n## Hacking Echidna as a developer\n\n### Installation\n\nTo run Echidna, you need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) first.\nThis will install [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) at the same time, which is required as well.\n\nThen run the following commands with your favorite terminal:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/w3c/echidna.git\ncd echidna\ncp config.js.example config.js\nnpm install\n```\n\n### Running it locally\n\n*Note: local setup of the full system is not supported currently due to dependency on W3C's DB and IPP system, but having mock services that emulate these pieces is our short-term goal.*\n\nIn your terminal, run the following:\n\n```bash\nnpm start [-- STAGING_PATH [HTTP_LOCATION [PORT [RESULT_PATH]]]]\n```\n\nYou may use the optional defined below:\n\n1. `STAGING_PATH`: path in the local filesystem where documents will be downloaded; *staged*.\n(Default `/var/www/html/trstaging/`.)\n2. `HTTP_LOCATION`: HTTP endpoint for [Specberus](https://github.com/w3c/specberus) and the [Third Party Resources Checker](https://github.com/dontcallmedom/third-party-resources-checker).\n(Default `http://localhost/trstaging/`.)\n3. `PORT`: where Echidna will be listening for publication requests.\n(Default `3000`.)\n4. `RESULT_PATH`: local path where Echidna will dump the results of publication requests in JSON format.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the configuration file `config.js`.\n\nOnce the server is started, you can throw publication requests at it through a `curl`/`POST` request to its enpoint, <http://localhost:3000/api>, or using the web-based testbed (described below).\n\nYou can also use a simple web client to send and monitor those requests, at <http://localhost:3000/ui>.\n\n### Testing Echidna\n\nThis section describes how to run Echidna's test suite to make sure that the project itself is working properly over time. Note that the test suite is not intended to test actual documents.\n\n#### Running the unit test suite\n\nYou can run the test suite with the following command line:\n\n```bash\nnpm test\n```\n\n#### Using test documents\n\nFor testing purposes, we are using a local web server.\nThe test server simulates some of the W3C services, such as the CSS and HTML validators, or the token authorization checker.\nIt also serves a set of sample drafts.\n\nYou can launch this test server separately by using:\n\n```bash\nnpm run testserver\n```\n\nWhen the test server is running, the testbed with all drafts will be available in <http://localhost:3001>.\n\n## Feedback and contributions\n\nPlease refer to our [contribution reference](https://github.com/w3c/echidna/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to learn how to contact us, give feedback, or actively contribute to this project.\n",

Let's make the Web rock our socks\noff!\n\nMedia Source Extensions:\n http://w3c.github.io/media-source/\n\n\nMedia Source Extensions Byte Stream Format Registry:\n http://w3c.github.io/media-source/byte-stream-format-registry.html\n\nWebM Byte Stream Format\n http://w3c.github.io/media-source/webm-byte-stream-format.html\n\nISO BMFF Byte Stream Format:\n http://w3c.github.io/media-source/isobmff-byte-stream-format.html\n\nMPEG-2 Transport Streams Byte Stream Format:\nhttp://w3c.github.io/media-source/mp2t-byte-stream-format.html\n\nMPEG Audio Byte Stream Format:\n http://w3c.github.io/media-source/mpeg-audio-byte-stream-format.html\n\n# Issue labeling and milestone guidance\n\n## Labels\nEach bug may have multiple labels.\n\n### “needs feedback”:\nThe issue is pending further clarification from the assignee, likely the original bug filer or another who reported aspects of the issue in the bug’s history. The feedback request needs to be in a comment associated with the addition of this label, along with a request for reassignment back to an editor once feedback is provided.\n\n### “needs author input”:\nThe editors are seeking input from web authors on the issue. For example, whether a requested change is useful or how best to expose information.\n\n### “needs follow-up”:\nThe assignee, likely an editor, needs to investigate more deeply before we can decide if this “needs implementation” or to otherwise move forward. The editors have discussed the issue and do not need to discuss it further until we have the resulting follow-up from the assignee. This includes things like determining external spec dependencies, seeking input from other spec owners and/or WGs, confirming the understanding of the nature of the bug, and beginning to formulate a path to a solution.\n\nThis doesn’t necessarily mean follow-up has “Started” or is “In Progress.”\n\n### “needs implementation”:\nThe steps needed to resolve this issue are clearly understood and agreed upon. This likely means drafting and committing a spec change, possibly via a pull request. No further discussion is necessary at this time, though review of the change may still be appropriate. Should that change, this label should be removed.\n\nFor a bug to be labeled with this, it needs to be understood well enough and in scope of the marked milestone. Otherwise, “needs follow-up” or punting milestone might be options.\n\nThis label does not refer to user agent implementations.\n\n### “blocked”:\nSome external dependency or another GitHub issue identified in comment associated with this label’s addition is (or might be) blocking progress on this bug.\n\n### “feature request”:\nThe issue is related to or requesting a new use case or capability not currently (explicitly) covered by the spec. Depending on the nature and impact of the request and the stage of the spec, it may be assigned to a future milestone.\n\n### “interoperability”:\nResolution of this issue is particularly important for interoperability among user agents. This may include breaking API changes, issues related to media compatibility across user agents, or ambiguous parts of the spec that could lead to different incompatible interpretations. There may be known or probable differing interpretations in implementations of the associated portion of the spec. If the identified issue is not addressed, there is a high likelihood of meaningful interoperability problems. The fix for the issue would need to provide a clear direction to prevent differing interpretations by user agents.\n\n### \"breaking change\"\nThe issue's resolution might cause re-entry to the current spec phase, for example CR.\n\n### “wontfix”, “invalid”, “duplicate”:\nSelf-explanatory :)\n\nIssues with these labels should always be closed (unless they were re-opened at which time an editor should probably remove these labels if the re-opening is accepted).\n\n\n## Milestones\nFor greater detail, see our V1 triage process announcement in [the archive](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html-media/2016Mar/0003.html).\n\n### “V#”:\nA bug in version # of the spec.\nCurrently, V1 is the first version of MSE (in CR in Q4 2015).\n\n### \"V#NonBlocking\"\nA bug in version # of the spec, which is an editorial change to improve spec language. These should not be treated as blocking on the WG timeline, so the clock may run out before all are fixed.\n\n### “VNext”:\nPerhaps to be addressed by some later version of the spec; not currently expected to be in scope of specific version of the spec. Typically, this milestone is correlated with issues labeled “feature request”. This is equivalent to Bugzilla’s RESOLVED LATER status. As such and to keep the issue tracker focused, issues with this milestone will generally be closed. When work on a new version of the spec starts, the V.Next issues, including those that are closed, should be reviewed and considered for the new version.\n\n### (no milestone):\nThe issue has not been triaged or the editors are currently discussing.\n",

This endpoint accepts parameters on its\nquery string. If the call is successful the generated content of the specification is returned.\n\n* `type` (required). The type of generator for this content. Currently the only supported value is\n  `respec`.\n* `url` (required). The URL of the draft to fetch and generate from.\n* `publishDate`. The date at which the publication of this draft is supposed to occur.\n\n### As a Node.js module\n\n```js\nconst SPEC_GEN = require('w3c-spec-generator');\nconst SERVER = SPEC_GEN.start();    // Optional port number (80 by default)\n// Now Spec Generator is listening on port 80\nSERVER.close();    // To stop the server\n```\n\n### Errors\n\nIf a required parameter is missing or has a value that is not understood, the generator returns a\n`500` error with a JSON payload the `error` field of which is the human-readable error message.\n\nIf the specific generator encounters a problem a similar error (mostly likely `500`) with the same\nsort of JSON message is returned. Specific generator types can extend this behaviour. The `respec`\ngenerator only returns `500` errors.\n\n## Writing generators\n\nGenerators are simple to write and new ones can easily be added. Simply add a new one under\n`generators` and load it into the `genMap` near the top of `server.js`.\n\nGenerators must export a `generate()` method which takes a URL, a set of parameters (from the list\nof optional ones that the API supports), and a callback to invoke upon completion.\n\nIf there is an error, the callback's first argument must be an object with a `status` field being\nan HTTP error code and a `message` field containing the error message. If the generator is\nsuccessful the first argument is `null` and the second is the generated content.\n\n## Running\n\nThe generator for ReSpec requires a running X server; in a headless environment, you will need to run it in connection with a Xvfb instance:\n```sh\nXvfb :3  &  # (where 3 is the display port)\nDISPLAY=:3 node server.js\n```\n\nA sufficient (but perhaps more than necessary) set of packages in a Debian/Ubuntu environment is `xvfb x11-xkb-utils xfonts-100dpi xfonts-75dpi xfonts-scalable xfonts-cyrillic x11-apps clang libdbus-1-dev libgtk2.0-dev libnotify-dev libgnome-keyring-dev libgconf2-dev libasound2-dev libcap-dev libcups2-dev libxtst-dev libxss1 libnss3-dev gcc-multilib g++-multilib`.\n",

      "readme": "\n# Spork\n\nSpork is a tool used to transform HTML documents, primarily specifications. It is more precisely\nused to publish W3C HTML (but can be used more generically).\n\nThe architecture is simple. The `spork` tool will run a given **profile**, which in turn will list\nsome **rules** to apply. The pipeline that this defines, together with a few configuration options,\nis what will transform the document.\n\n## Installation\n\nThe simplest way in which to install this is to clone the repository, then run `npm install -d` at\nits root.\n\n## `spork`\n\nThis gets installed with `npm install` (or `npm link` from the repo, which is likely better). It\ntakes the name of a profile (currently `html` or `html-wd`) and the path to the configuration file. For example:\n\n`spork html ./config.json`\n\nThis can also be used as a library, exposing a `run()` method. It is the primary entry point that\nwill manage the profile, handle some common tasks, and use that to process the document.\n\n### Configuration\n\n`spork` needs a configuration file with the following:\n\n* `outDir`. The path to the directory to which to save the\n  generated spec. Make sure the directory exists before launching the command.\n* `logFile`. The file to which to log. Optional. If absent no file logging takes place.\n* `production`. Set to `false` for the development copy\n\nFor example:\n\n```\n{\n    \"outDir\":       \"/Projects/spork/out/html/\"\n,   \"logFile\":      \"/Projects/spork/out/logs.txt\"\n,   \"production\":   false\n}\n```\n\n## Profiles\n\nThere are currently two profiles, `html` and `html-wd`. Both are under `./profiles/`.\n\nProfiles export a specific interface.\n\n* `name`. The name of the profile. Used in reporting.\n* `url`. The source from which to fetch the document.\n* `configuration`. An object with content that can be used to control the behaviour of some rules or\n  downstream processes.\n    * `configuration.downloads`. This field of `configuration` is worth bringing forward. It is a\n      mapping of URLs to paths (relative to the output directory). Those URLs will be downloaded to\n      those paths.\n* `resources(res)`. If this method is defined, it will get called for every resource that the source\n  page attempts to download. This can be used to inform later processing (rewriting links,\n  downloading dependencies through `configuration.downloads`).\n* `setup(cb)`. If present, this method is called at the beginning so a profile can make some\n  preparations. Once it's done, it needs to call `cb`.\n* `rules`. This is an array of rules objects that will be processed in that order.\n* `finalise(config, specFiles, otherFiles, cb)`. Once processing is finished (successfully) if this\n  exists it is called with the configuration that was used, the specification files (there can be\n  several in case splitting happened), the other files (typically images and such), and a `cb` to\n  call when processing it done. All files are given relative to the output directory. A typical\n  usage is to generate the manifest for Echidna.\n\n## Editing\n\nTo edit the HTML specification, you should edit files in `res/` or `rules/`.\n\n* `res/` files are resources that are injected into the specification using rules.\n* `rules/` contains transformation code (see below).\n\nIf you create a new rule, make sure to add it to\n https://github.com/w3c/spork/blob/master/profiles/html.js\n\nFor each change, do a pull request with the associated link to the bug, if any.\n\n## Rules\n\nRules are specific objects that implement a basic transformation to a spec. They have the following\ninterface.\n\n* `name`. The required name of the rule, used for logging and the such.\n* `landscape`. A string of HTML that needs to describe the transformation when it causes a change\n  that should be documented as a difference from WHATWG HTML.\n* `transform()`. The method that does the transformation. Be careful: this is run in a PhantomJS\n  context, it **cannot** use anything defined in its context. What happens is that it gets\n  stringified and given params (based on another method described below), then evaluated in the\n  PhantomJS context.\n* `params(configuration)`. This method, if defined, is called before `transform()` is serialised. It\n  is expected to return an **array** of JavaScript objects that can be serialised to JSON. Each one\n  of these objects will get passed as an argument to `transform()`. This is typically used to load\n  templates and content.\n* `copy`. This is an object. If defined its keys are paths to files (from the root of the `spork`\n  repository) and values are where to copy those files to in the output directory.\n\n"

It contains the [Touch Events Level 2](http://w3c.github.io/touch-events/) editors draft (which contains all the changes from an old v1-errata branch and the [Touch Events Extension Working Group Note](http://www.w3.org/TR/touch-events-extensions/)).\n2. v1 - this branch is it not active. (It was the working branch for the v1 specification.)\n\n# Process for Landing Changes\n\nPer the group's [2015-Jan-27 agreement](http://www.w3.org/2015/01/27-touchevents-minutes.html#item05), the following process is used to review and approve Pull Requests:\n\n* Submit a pull request and post the PR's link to the [public-touchevents](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-touchevents/) e-mail list asking for feedback.\n* As soon as one of the listed spec editors approves the PR it can be merged.\n* If there's debate over a PR that has already landed, it may be reverted until consensus is reached.\n\n## Tests\n\nFor normative changes, a corresponding\n[web-platform-tests](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt) PR is highly appreciated. Typically,\nboth PRs will be merged at the same time. Note that a test change that contradicts the spec should\nnot be merged before the corresponding spec change. If testing is not practical, please explain why\nand if appropriate [file an issue](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/issues/new) to follow\nup later. Add the `type:untestable` or `type:missing-coverage` label as appropriate.\n"

      "readme": "# WAI Dynamic Planning\n\nThis is the repository for the WAI dynamic planning resource. Developed by the\n[Education and Outreach Working Group (EOWG)](//w3.org/WAI/EO/) with support from the [WAI-DEV project](//w3.org/WAI/DEV/), co-funded by the European Commission <abbr title=\"Information Society Technologies\">IST</abbr> Programme. \n\nYou can find the current draft state of the document on [this Github Pages site][GHPage]\n\n## Contributing\n\nThe main content pages of this resource are written in Kramdown, a version of Markdown. The [Quick Reference](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html) provides details on how to write content.\n\nEditing a page on GitHub works just like a Wiki.\n\nEither browse to the page in this repository and edit the file there, or visit the page in [Github Page][GHPage] and click on \"Fork and Edit\" at the bottom of the page.\n\nYou can start editing right away. If you get the following note, this is expected behavior:\n\n> You are editing a file in a project you do not have write access to. We are forking this project for you (if one does not yet exist) to write your proposed changes to. Submitting a change to this file will write it to a new branch in your fork so you can send a pull request.\n\nIt is technical for “All right, make your edits, we make sure you can send them in as a proposal!”\n\nDon’t forget to add some descriptive text at the bottom that comments your change. Try to be concise. Click the “Propose this change” button to continue. Then you get another comment field, you can write down your motivation for the change here. Once you click “Send pull request” the editor of the notified of your proposal and may adopt it.\n\n### Helpers\n\nThe resource also provides some additional convenience helpers that are used to structure the code. These are included in the page using the following code:\n\n```\n{::nomarkdown}\n<%= activity %>\n{:/}\n```\n\nThe following elements are available:\n\n<dl>\n  <dt>expand_collapse</dt>\n    <dd>Includes the markup for the expand all/collapse all controls, and adds in the markup to support expand/collapse within activities.</dd>\n\n  <dt>activity</dt>\n    <dd>Starts an activity block within a page. To end the block use <code><%= activity :end %></code></dd>\n\n  <dt>activity_body</dt>\n    <dd>Indicates where the body of the activity begins. The body is collapsed by default and expanded when the activity head is clicked.</dd>\n\n  <dt>support</dt>\n    <dd>Starts the block for supporting material. To end the block use <code><%= support :end %></code></dd>\n\n  <dt>more_information</dt>\n    <dd>Starts the block for adding additional resources that add more information to this resource. To end the block use <code><%= more_information :end %></code></dd>\n\n  <dt>related</dt>\n    <dd>Starts the block for adding activities that are related to an activity. To end the block use <code><%= related :end %></code></dd>\n\n  <dt>w3url</dt>\n    <dd>Creates a link to a W3C page so that when this resource is hosted on GitHub Pages, the links work as expected, but when it is deployed into w3.org, the links are all relative. Use this in combination with the <code>link_to</code> helper:</dd>\n    <dd><code><%= link_to \"WAI Homepage\", (w3url '/WAI/') %></code></dd>\n</dl>\n\n## Structure\n\nThis resource is built using [Middleman](//middlemanapp.com/), a static site generation tool. To build a local version of the resource do the following:\n\n* [Install Middleman](//middlemanapp.com/basics/install/)\n* Clone a version of this repository\n* Install the repository dependencies, `bundle install` in the repository root directory\n* Run the server, `middleman server`\n\nThis resource uses GitHub Pages to display the current draft version. If you wish to update this version from your cloned repository you need to:\n\n* Build a GitHub version of the resource\n\n    `BUILD_FOR_GITHUB=1 middleman build`\n\n* Deploy the build to GitHub\n\n    `middleman deploy`\n\nThe environment variable, `BUILD_FOR_GITHUB`, is used to configure URLs. So when the resource is deployed on GitHub Pages the URLs are absolute, and when built for production deployment in w3.org they are relative.\n\n## Deploying to live\n\nThe following steps are required in order to deploy this to the live w3.org environment. In order to deploy you will need the permissions to update content on w3.org.\n\n1. Build deployable version.\n\n    `middleman build`\n\n    This builds the content into the local `build` directory. Removing the `BUILD_FOR_GITHUB` means that the URLs in the pages built will be relative rather than absolute and that the `excol.js` scripts will be handled in a different way.\n\n2. CVS update the `/WAI/impl`, `/WAI/users`, and `/WAI/Policy` directories in your local version of the repository.\n\n3. Copy the following from the `build` directory to the local CVS `impl` directory:\n\n    * index.html\n    * acknowledgements.html\n    * implement.html\n    * initiate.html\n    * plan.html\n    * sustain.html\n    * stylesheets/*\n    * javascripts/*\n\n4. If necessary, edit the Planning & Implementing overview and make changes to the `/WAI/managing.html` page.\n\n5. If necessary, edit the following pages and update the navigation to change the label and URL for this resource:\n\n    * /WAI/managing.html\n    * /WAI/Policy/harmon.html\n    * /WAI/Policy/Overview.html\n    * /WAI/impl/pol.html\n    * /WAI/impl/improving.html\n    * /WAI/users/involving.html\n    * /WAI/impl/software.html\n\n6. Commit all the changes to the w3.org CVS repository.\n\n7. Check all the pages to find the typo that you accidentally left in.\n\n[GHPage]: https://w3c.github.io/wai-dynamic-planning/",

Instead, go to https://github.com/w3c/wot, where GitHub will have found your new branch and will offer to open a pull-request (base fork: `w3c/wot`, base: `master` ... head fork: `{your-account}/wot`, compare: `{your-branch}`).\n* If you have a separate change proposal for the same file, go back to your master branch and repeat the process from clicking the edit icon.\n* If the pull-request discussion expects you to update your change proposal, go to your branch corresponding to the PR, click the edit icon, and commit directly to that branch.\n\n### Command-line based Pull-Request\n\n* [Fork](https://github.com/w3c/wot#fork-destination-box) the `w3c/wot` repository into your own account\n* Create a branch in your fork for one particular topic (e.g., a single IG scope item) with a proper name (e.g., `charter-ig-scope-plugfest`)\n* Make your edits and commit\n* Push the new branch to your own repository fork\n* GitHub will automatically offer to open a pull-request to `w3c/wot` (from your new branch to master)\n\n### Github Help\n\n* https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/ provides a tutorial on GitHub pull-requests.\n* If you have not worked with GitHub in this way before, we will give direct assistance.\n",

It allows the standards development organization to maintain vendor neutral control over a specification, and thus protect the consensus found within a Working Group.\n\nIn the course of the development of materials within the W3C, Task Force Participants will make contributions. Those contributions will be integrated into the jointly developed work thus creating shared copyright on the Task Force Participant's contribution.

Furthermore, the Task Force Participant understands that W3C will be able to exercise all rights as a copyright owner of Task Force Participant's contribution, including enforcement against infringers without additional agreement or notice.\n\nNothing in this agreement restricts the Task Force Participant from using their individual contributions as they wish, even if those have later been amalgamated into joint works. Where W3C releases materials under a permissive license such as the W3C Software License or CC-BY, nothing in this agreement should be read to restrict the Task Force Participant from exercising the permissions granted by that license. The Task Force Participant represents that they are legally entitled to grant the above license.

Task Force Participants will refrain from defaming, harassing or otherwise offending other participants. The [Section 3.1 of the Process Document](https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#ParticipationCriteria) applies, as does the W3C [Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/).\n\nThe Task Force Participant will refrain from sending unsolicited commercial messages to W3C mailing-lists and other promotional activities for personal matters or for third parties.

Due to this, conversations may happens on GitHub or on\nmailing lists, in issue trackers or on IRC, and then some further places.\n\nPheme is meant to provide an integration point for a very varied set of information sources, such\nthat the stream can be unified and then queried. Consumers of Pheme's stream could be a dashboard\napplication exposing what is going on around a given project, or an emailing service that would\nnotify people of certain specific events.\n\nCurrently Pheme can be at the receiving end of GitHub hooks (several if need be, including having a\nseparate secret for each) and can poll for arbitrary RSS/Atom content. Adding support for more\ntypes of content should be straightforward.\n\nThere is a dashboard application that uses Pheme called [Midgard](https://github.com/w3c/midgard).\n\nSince Pheme and Midgard work together, I have written up development/deployment documentation that\ncovers both, available in the [`DEVELOPMENT.md` \ndocument](https://github.com/w3c/midgard/blob/master/DEVELOPMENT.md) there.\n"

      "readme": "[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Automattic/_s.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Automattic/_s)\n\n_s\n===\n\nHi. I'm a starter theme called `_s`, or `underscores`, if you like. I'm a theme meant for hacking so don't use me as a Parent Theme. Instead try turning me into the next, most awesome, WordPress theme out there. That's what I'm here for.\n\nMy ultra-minimal CSS might make me look like theme tartare but that means less stuff to get in your way when you're designing your awesome theme. Here are some of the other more interesting things you'll find here:\n\n* A just right amount of lean, well-commented, modern, HTML5 templates.\n* A helpful 404 template.\n* A sample custom header implementation in `inc/custom-header.php` that can be activated by uncommenting one line in `functions.php` and adding the code snippet found in the comments of `inc/custom-header.php` to your `header.php` template.\n* Custom template tags in `inc/template-tags.php` that keep your templates clean and neat and prevent code duplication.\n* Some small tweaks in `inc/extras.php` that can improve your theming experience.\n* A script at `js/navigation.js` that makes your menu a toggled dropdown on small screens (like your phone), ready for CSS artistry. It's enqueued in `functions.php`.\n* 2 sample CSS layouts in `layouts/` for a sidebar on either side of your content.\n* Smartly organized starter CSS in `style.css` that will help you to quickly get your design off the ground.\n* Licensed under GPLv2 or later. :) Use it to make something cool.\n\nGetting Started\n---------------\n\nIf you want to keep it simple, head over to http://underscores.me and generate your `_s` based theme from there. You just input the name of the theme you want to create, click the \"Generate\" button, and you get your ready-to-awesomize starter theme.\n\nIf you want to set things up manually, download `_s` from GitHub. The first thing you want to do is copy the `_s` directory and change the name to something else (like, say, `megatherium`), and then you'll need to do a five-step find and replace on the name in all the templates.\n\n1. Search for `'_s'` (inside single quotations) to capture the text domain.\n2. Search for `_s_` to capture all the function names.\n3. Search for `Text Domain: _s` in style.css.\n4. Search for <code>&nbsp;_s</code> (with a space before it) to capture DocBlocks.\n5. Search for `_s-` to capture prefixed handles.\n\nOR\n\n* Search for: `'_s'` and replace with: `'megatherium'`\n* Search for: `_s_` and replace with: `megatherium_`\n* Search for: `Text Domain: _s` and replace with: `Text Domain: megatherium` in style.css.\n* Search for: <code>&nbsp;_s</code> and replace with: <code>&nbsp;Megatherium</code>\n* Search for: `_s-` and replace with: `megatherium-`\n\nThen, update the stylesheet header in `style.css` and the links in `footer.php` with your own information. Next, update or delete this readme.\n\nNow you're ready to go! The next step is easy to say, but harder to do: make an awesome WordPress theme. :)\n\nGood luck!\n"

It allows the standards development organization to maintain vendor neutral control over a specification, and thus protect the consensus found within a Working Group.\n\nIn the course of the development of materials within the W3C, Task Force Participants will make contributions. Those contributions will be integrated into the jointly developed work thus creating shared copyright on the Task Force Participant's contribution. Most W3C Specifications contain a section with acknowledgement of contributions.\n\nTask Force Participants grant to the W3C a perpetual, nonexclusive, royalty-free, world-wide right and license under any Task Force Participant's copyrights on his or her contributions, to copy, publish and distribute the contribution under a license of W3C's choosing. Additionally, the Task Force Participant grants a right and license of the same scope to any derivative works prepared by the W3C and based on, or incorporating all or part of, his or her contribution and that any derivative works of this contribution prepared by the W3C shall be solely owned by the W3C. Furthermore, the Task Force Participant understands that W3C will be able to exercise all rights as a copyright owner of Task Force Participant's contribution, including enforcement against infringers without additional agreement or notice.\n\nNothing in this agreement restricts the Task Force Participant from using their individual contributions as they wish, even if those have later been amalgamated into joint works. Where W3C releases materials under a permissive license such as the W3C Software License or CC-BY, nothing in this agreement should be read to restrict the Task Force Participant from exercising the permissions granted by that license. The Task Force Participant represents that they are legally entitled to grant the above license. If their employer(s) have rights to intellectual property that the Task Force Participant creates that includes the contributions, they represent that they have received permission to make contributions on behalf of that employer or that the employer has waived such rights for the contributions to W3C.\n\n\n## Decency\n\nThe Task Force Participant will participate in the W3C Group in a decent way. Task Force Participants will refrain from defaming, harassing or otherwise offending other participants. The [Section 3.1 of the Process Document](https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#ParticipationCriteria) applies, as does the W3C [Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/).\n\nThe Task Force Participant will refrain from sending unsolicited commercial messages to W3C mailing-lists and other promotional activities for personal matters or for third parties. This is especially required from Task Force Participants sending messages to public W3C Groups.\n",

Ensure the security and privacy of the individuals reading the document;\n2. Ensure proper access by everyone regardless of disability;\n3. Consider the different languages, scripts, and cultures from around the world;\n4. Ensure that individuals can read properly the normative and non-normative parts of the document when scripting is disabled or not available;\n5. Consider the impact of the design on the W3C publication ecosystem: publication tools, authoring tools, editors\n6. Ensure that the W3C Brand and general W3C website integration are respected, per the W3C Communications Team;\n7. Consider the Web user agent compatibility risks (past, present, and future) and the long term maintenance.\n8. Use valid CSS and follow CSS best practices.\n9. Ensure that the document can be printed beautifully.\n\nDiscussions happen through issues, pull requests, and on spec-prod@w3.org.\n\n\n## Release Process\n\n### Principles\n\nFor the purpose of this project, there are two guiding principles to guarantee efficiency and progressive design:\n\n1. **W3C MUST NOT change the design of technical reports already published.**\n2. **W3C MAY adopt a new design for technical reports only once per year, on the 1st of January.**\n\n### Process for approving a new design\n\nFor any given year:\n\n1. No general proposals for a new design can be made after September 30.\n2. No final design can be proposed after October 31. This is intended to ensure a minimum of one month for wide review of the final design before formal adoption.\n3. The deadline to obtain W3C Director approval for the final design is November 30. No substantive changes can be made to the final design after approval. This is intended to guarantee a minimum of one month advanced notice for the W3C publication ecosystem (publication tools, authoring tools, editors).\n4. The W3C Webmaster must deploy the new style sheets and associated assets no later than December 1st, if approved by the W3C Director.\n5. The new design becomes effective on January 1st of the following year for a 12 months duration.\n\nThe dates above are deadlines but the earlier the better, especially when considering the schedule of the W3C TPAC meeting.\n\nOne _Design Point Person_ per year is in charge of managing general proposals,\nproducing and proposing the final design,\nensuring [wide reviews](https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#wide-review),\naddressing issues and pull requests,\nand obtaining the W3C Director approval.\nOnly the *Design Point Person*&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;and, occasionally, W3C staff&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;should commit to the common branches of the project.\nThis individual must engage with the Web Community at large and is appointed by the W3C Director.\n\nNOTE: For 2015, the *Design Point Person* is @fantasai.\n\nIf the W3C Director cannot approve a new design within a given year, the design of the current year remains effective for the following year.\n\nThe W3C Director MAY delegate responsibility (generally to other individuals in the W3C Team) for his role described in this document.\n\n### Bug Fixing\n\nBug fixing MAY happen on a continuous basis for all style sheets. Published styles are include in releases/ for maintenance purposes.\n\n#### Branches\n\nAt any point in time, branch `gh-pages` is used for work on *next year's TR design*, until the first candidate release is branched out from it.\nFrom that moment on, `gh-pages` becomes the development branch for the following cycle.\n\nBranches with years in their names (eg, `2016`) are used exclusively for bug-fixing candidate releases for that specific year.\nCommits to `gh-pages` will *not* be propagated to yearly branches.\n\n### Considerations\n\n1. There are no backward compatibility issues since we never change the design of documents already published and the new design MAY NOT accommodate the large set of documents published in the past by W3C anyway.\n2. Unique design among all W3C /TR documents is no longer guaranteed. Two W3C specifications published in two different years MAY look completely different. While design consistency from year to year is NOT required, it should be kept in mind and balanced to avoid confusing the Web community.\n3. A new design does NOT have to address all possible future refinements before being adopted, such as taking into account all possible future user preferences and how to display all future combinations of those.\n4. As a side note, Proposed Recommendations published after the 15th of October should easily allow the W3C Advisory Committee to visualize the document using the new design of the following year. Note however that such new design may be tweaked until November 30 or rejected by the Director.\n"

It allows the standards development organization to maintain vendor neutral control over a specification, and thus protect the consensus found within a Working Group.\n\nIn the course of the development of materials within the W3C, Task Force Participants will make contributions. Those contributions will be integrated into the jointly developed work thus creating shared copyright on the Task Force Participant's contribution. Most W3C Specifications contain a section with acknowledgement of contributions.\n\nTask Force Participants grant to the W3C a perpetual, nonexclusive, royalty-free, world-wide right and license under any Task Force Participant's copyrights on his or her contributions, to copy, publish and distribute the contribution under a license of W3C's choosing. Additionally, the Task Force Participant grants a right and license of the same scope to any derivative works prepared by the W3C and based on, or incorporating all or part of, his or her contribution and that any derivative works of this contribution prepared by the W3C shall be solely owned by the W3C. Furthermore, the Task Force Participant understands that W3C will be able to exercise all rights as a copyright owner of Task Force Participant's contribution, including enforcement against infringers without additional agreement or notice.\n\nNothing in this agreement restricts the Task Force Participant from using their individual contributions as they wish, even if those have later been amalgamated into joint works. Where W3C releases materials under a permissive license such as the W3C Software License or CC-BY, nothing in this agreement should be read to restrict the Task Force Participant from exercising the permissions granted by that license. The Task Force Participant represents that they are legally entitled to grant the above license. If their employer(s) have rights to intellectual property that the Task Force Participant creates that includes the contributions, they represent that they have received permission to make contributions on behalf of that employer or that the employer has waived such rights for the contributions to W3C.\n\n\n## Decency\n\nThe Task Force Participant will participate in the W3C Group in a decent way. Task Force Participants will refrain from defaming, harassing or otherwise offending other participants. The [Section 3.1 of the Process Document](https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#ParticipationCriteria) applies, as does the W3C [Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/).\n\nThe Task Force Participant will refrain from sending unsolicited commercial messages to W3C mailing-lists and other promotional activities for personal matters or for third parties. This is especially required from Task Force Participants sending messages to public W3C Groups.\n",

Through it we are making available data on Specifications, Groups, Organizations and Users.\n\nWe will be expanding what information we expose over time.\n\nThe W3C API is a read-only Web API based on the JSON format exposing only public data.\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe W3C API is documented at [https://w3c.github.io/w3c-api/](https://w3c.github.io/w3c-api/) and the details about the different endpoints are available at [https://api.w3.org/doc](https://api.w3.org/doc).\n\nWebhooks are documented at [https://w3c.github.io/w3c-api/webhooks](https://w3c.github.io/w3c-api/webhooks).\n\n## Libraries\n\n[Apiary](https://github.com/w3c/apiary) is a simple JavaScript library to leverage the W3C API.\nThis library is intended to be used from W3C pages: domain pages, group pages, personal pages, etc.\nWith Apiary, you can inject data that is retrieved using the W3C API, in a declarative way using *placeholders*.\n\n[node-w3capi](https://github.com/w3c/node-w3capi) provides a client for the W3C API, which exposes information about things such as specifications, groups, users, etc. It follows a simple pattern in which one builds up a query, and then causes the data to be fetched.\n\nFor using the W3C API with other languages see the [list of libraries for working with JSON HAL](https://github.com/mikekelly/hal_specification/wiki/Libraries).\n\n## Feedback and contributions\n\nThe code of this API is not public because it is highly tied to the W3C database infrastructure and would expose sensitive information. However, we welcome feedback and strongly encourage people to submit issues [here](https://github.com/w3c/w3c-api/issues).\n\nYou can also join the [W3C's IRC](http://www.w3.org/Project/IRC/) [#webapi](irc://irc.w3.org:6667/webapi) channel.\n\n## Historical references\n\n* [W3C Data Platform](http://w3c.github.io/w3c-api/data-platform.html)\n* [Data Platform Design](http://w3c.github.io/w3c-api/data-platform-design.html)\n"

      "readme": "\n# Repository Manager (Ash-Nazg)\n\nOne interface to find all group contributors and in IPR bind them.\n\nThis tool was created to support contributions made to a group, under the form of pull requests, in\norder to assess whether they are IPR-OK or not. It still has some rough edges but hopefully it can\nbe usable enough to get started, and perfected over time.\n\nThe tool is at currently in [my labs hatchery](https://labs.w3.org/hatchery/repo-manager/), but \nhopefully at some point some kind soul will place it at a more memorable URL.\n\nWhen you get there, you will be asked to log in through GitHub. You can't do much without that, \nbecause most of the actions you can undertake through the tool (or that the tool can undertake on\nyour behalf when reacting to a GitHub event) require authorised access to GitHub. The permissions\nit requires are rather broad; that is because it is difficult to be granular with GitHub \npermissions. The tool isn't doing anything unholy.\n\nOnce you log in your user will be created; if you need to be an admin just ask someone to give you\nthat flag from the \"Edit User\" page.\n\nIf you need to deploy or to hack on this tool, you will want to read the\n[Development Guide](https://github.com/w3c/ash-nazg/blob/master/DEVELOPMENT.md)\n\n## Common Tool\n\n### New Repository\n\nThis is basically what people should use when they want to start a new specification with the WG/CG.\nIt gives you a choice of the organisations under which you are allowed to create a new repo\n(including  your own user), and you can pick the name of the repo and the groups to which it \nbelongs.\n\nHitting \"Create\" can take a little while as the tool does all of the following, live:\n\n* Creates the repo on GitHub\n* Adds several files, notably the `LICENSE.md` and `CONTRIBUTE.md`, a `w3c.json` file which can be\n  used by other tools, and an `index.html` that's a bare-bones ReSpec spec ready to be edited.\n* Adds a hook to the repo such that pull requests and comments on them are sent to us, including one\n  distinct cryptographic secret per repo.\n* Saves all the relevant info on our side.\n\nMost users should only ever have to use that. Once done they can go and play in their repo.\n\n### Import Repository\n\nThis is the same as \"New\" but for an existing repo. It will ***never*** overwrite something there so\nit is the user's responsibility to check that the repo is okay once imported.\n\n### Logout\n\nThis should be obvious. If it isn't, please don't use the application.\n\n### How Pull Requests Get Handled\n\nWhenever a pull request is made against a repo that is under the tool's management, we get notified. \nWe use this information to assess if the PR is acceptable (i.e. has all its contributors in at least \none of the groups that the repo belongs to).\n\nCount as contributors not just the person making the pull request, but also anyone added either in \nthe PR description or in any subsequent comment using \"`+@username`\" on a line on its own. If a \ncontributor was added by mistake, she can be removed with \"`-@username`\" on a line on its own. This\nincludes the person making the PR. Thanks to that, you can issue a PR completely on behalf of \nsomeone else.\n\nEvery time a PR is created or has a comment with a username change, the status of the PR is changed. \nIf it's acceptable it'll get changed to green with a note indicating that it's fine; if not it gets\nchanged to some ugly brown with a red cross (and a link that people can use to check the issue in \nmore detail).\n\n\n## Admin Tools\n\n### Currently Open Pull Requests\n\nThis list all PRs that are now open, even old ones. It lists useful details such as which users are \nbeing problematic either because they are unknown (not in the system at all) or outside (known to \nthe system but not in one of the right groups for that repo).\n\nYou can go to PR details by clicking \"Details\".\n\n### PR Details\n\nIf the PR is not in an acceptable state, this will list problematic users with a link to fix them \neach. The fix can either be \"Add to system\" or \"Edit\" (details below).\n\nThe idea is that the vast majority of non-acceptable PRs in the first few weeks will come from \npeople who are simply not known, but that relatively quickly it ought to become a less frequent \noccurrence.\n\nIf it so happens that all of the problematic users can be added to the system or to the right group, \nand that you have done so, then you can return to the PR details page and hit \"Revalidate\". We could \nrevalidate every time a user is added or edited, but it's pretty costly so for the time being it is \ndone this way. Revalidation will of course update both the local state and the PR's mergability \nindicator on GitHub.\n\n### Add User to system\n\nFor users that are unknown to the system, they can be added by following on of those links and just\nclicking that button. This is always an innocuous operation; it does not give the user any special \nrights nor can it make a PR OK (since the user needs to be in a group for that).\n\n### Active Last Week PRs\n\nThis is a list of pull requests, in any state, that saw activity last week. They can be filtered \naccording to the affiliation of the companies that made the contributions. This is essentially so \nthat AC reps who have people in CGs who are only supposed to contribute to some specific work but \nnot all of it can monitor what's been going on and avail themselves of their 45 days retraction \nwindow. Similar affordances are available as for the list of open PRs.\n\n### Edit User\n\nThe interface to edit users is where the W3C data model and the GitHub data model get to meet. This \nalone is scary; I've tried to make it less scary.\n\nA list of the groups known to the system is shown, the user can be added and removed from them \nthere. If the user's affiliation is unset, once some groups have been added you can click \"Set\". \nThis will load up a list that is the *intersection* of membership in the selected groups. The UI \nwill also try to select the user with the name matching their GitHub profile (which may not always \nwork, but often does). Hitting \"OK\" will associate the GH user with the W3C user, making it possible \nfor us to use affiliation information. Don't forget to hit \"Save\".\n\nThis is a little convoluted but it's the best I could do with the current APIs from both GitHub and \nthe W3C backend. Hopefully it can be simplified in the future.\n\n### Admin > Users\n\nThis is a list of users. Things you can do there include making them admins and giving them blanket \ncontribution rights. **USE EITHER WITH CARE**.\n\nAdmins should normally not be able to break the system, but they can enter all sorts of bogus \ninformation that would be really annoying. Only grant admin when you're sure; it's probably better \nto ask others first.\n\nBlanket is a different type of superpower: users with blanket access are considered acceptable \ncontributors to ALL repos, irrespective of their group memberships. This should normally be \nrestricted to W3C team people.\n\n### Admin > Groups\n\nThis is a list of all W3C groups. You will note that most have an \"Add\" button next to them: those \nare the ones that are in W3C but not in this system. Please do *not* start adding groups unless they \nexplicitly want to be managed under this system. We only want people to create/import repos for \ngroups that are actually using this system. Clicking \"Add\" makes that group one of those available \nfor repos and users to belong to, adding too many will make those dialogs unwieldy.\n\nShare & Enjoy!\n",

You can paste them there.\n\n## Warnings\n\nThere are good reasons that this is not supported directly by Echidna. In the general case, if you\nhad a reliable process to detect all the resources that a Web page might load then you would have a\nsolution to the Halting Problem.\n\nSo keep in mind that this isn't perfect. For instance, if your document loads stuff that causes\nother stuff to be loaded by script over time, it's possible that the process will time out before\nsome resources are loaded, and so they won't get loaded. For specs that should not happen, but for\ninstance if ReSpec+PhantomJS are being slow together you could be out of luck.\n\nThis also does not generate the first entry (the main document) because it can't guess all the\nparameters for that. Presumably that's not too bad a problem.\n\n## Installation\n\nTo use it **from the command line**, type:\n```bash\n$ npm install -g echidna-manifester\n```\n\nTo use **as a Node.js module**, add it to your `package.json` file:\n```javascript\n\"dependencies\": {\n    ⋮\n    \"echidna-manifest\": \"^0.1.0\"\n}\n```\nAnd *require* it as usual:\n```javascript\nvar em = require('echidna-manifester');\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n**From the command line**, invoke it with these arguments:\n```bash\n$ echidna-manifester <PATH/TO/FILE> [OPTIONS-AS-JSON]\n```\n\nSome examples:\n```bash\n$ echidna-manifester http://berjon.com/\n$ echidna-manifester /tmp/spec.html '{\"format\": \"plain\"}'\n$ echidna-manifester https://foo.com/bar.html '{\"includeErrors\": true, \"includeTypes\": true}'\n```\n\n**As a Node.js module**: `echidna-manifester` exports only one function, `run`.\nThese are its arguments:\n\n1. `url` (`String`): required\n2. `options` (`Object`): optional.  \n  If absent, default options will be applied.\n3. `callback` (`Function`): optional.  \n  Signature: `function(data)`.  \n  If absent, the output will be `console.log`ged.\n\n```javascript\nvar em = require('echidna-manifester');\nvar url = 'https://foo.com/bar.html';\nvar options = {\n    \"format\": \"json\",\n    \"compactUrls\": false,\n};\nvar callback = function(data) {\n    console.dir(data);\n};\n\nem.run(url, options, callback);\n```\n\n## Output formats and options\n\nThe object `options` may include these properties (default values are **in bold**):\n\n* `'format'`:  \n  {**`'manifest'`**, `'json'`, `'plain'`}  \n  * `'manifest'`: a format that is appropriate for an [Echidna](https://github.com/w3c/echidna) manifest\n  * `'json'`: a JSON object\n  * `'plain'`: text, one line per resource, fields separated by spaces: `URL STATUS [TYPE]`\n* `'compactUrls'`  \n  {**`true`**, `false`}  \n  Omit the beginning of the URL\n* `'includeErrors'`  \n  {`true`, **`false`**}  \n  Whether resources that could *not* be loaded should be included in the output, too\n* `'includeTypes'`  \n  {`true`, **`false`**}  \n  Add a string to idenfity the type of resource (kind of MIME), if possible;  \n  this parameter is ignored when the format is `'manifest'`\n\n### Examples\n\nAll these examples use `example/dummy-spec.html`.\n\nUse from the command line, with default options:\n```bash\n$ node echidna-manifester example/dummy-spec.html\ndummy-spec.html\nfoo.css\nbaz.js\nhttp://www.w3.org/Consortium/Offices/w3coffice.png\nhttp://www.w3.org/2014/10/stdvidthumb.png\nbar.jpeg\n```\n\nInvoke from JavaScript, specifying JSON output and failed resources too:\n```javascript\nvar em = require('echidna-manifester');\n\nem.run(\n    'example/dummy-spec.html',\n    {\n        \"format\":        \"json\",\n        \"includeErrors\": true\n    },\n    processJSON\n);\n```\n\n```json\n{\n    \"ok\": [\n        {\"url\": \"dummy-spec.html\"},\n        {\"url\": \"foo.css\"},\n        {\"url\": \"baz.js\"},\n        {\"url\": \"http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Offices/w3coffice.png\"},\n        {\"url\": \"http://www.w3.org/2014/10/stdvidthumb.png\"},\n        {\"url\": \"bar.jpeg\"}\n    ],\n    \"error\": [\n        {\"url\": \"i-do-not-exist.css\"},\n        {\"url\": \"i-do-not-exist.svg\"}\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nFrom the command line, in plain text, with full URLs and with types:\n```bash\n$ node echidna-manifester example/dummy-spec.html '{\"format\": \"plain\", \"includeTypes\": true, \"compactUrls\": false}'\nexample/dummy-spec.html ok html\nexample/foo.css ok css\nexample/baz.js ok js\nhttp://www.w3.org/Consortium/Offices/w3coffice.png ok img\nhttp://www.w3.org/2014/10/stdvidthumb.png ok img\nexample/bar.jpeg ok img\n```\n\n",

By committing here, you agree to that licensing of your contributions.\n\nIf you are not the sole contributor to a contribution (pull request), please identify all contributors in the pull request comment.\n\nTo add a contributor (other than yourself, that's automatic), mark them one per line as follows:\n\n```\n+@github_username\n```\n\nIf you added a contributor by mistake, you can remove them in a comment with:\n\n```\n-@github_username\n```\n\nIf you are making a pull request on behalf of someone else but you had no part in designing the feature, you can remove yourself with the above syntax.\n\n\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright is a very important part of standardization activities. It allows the standards development organization to maintain vendor neutral control over a specification, and thus protect the consensus found within a Working Group.\n\nIn the course of the development of materials within the W3C, Task Force Participants will make contributions. Those contributions will be integrated into the jointly developed work thus creating shared copyright on the Task Force Participant's contribution. Most W3C Specifications contain a section with acknowledgement of contributions.\n\nTask Force Participants grant to the W3C a perpetual, nonexclusive, royalty-free, world-wide right and license under any Task Force Participant's copyrights on his or her contributions, to copy, publish and distribute the contribution under a license of W3C's choosing. Additionally, the Task Force Participant grants a right and license of the same scope to any derivative works prepared by the W3C and based on, or incorporating all or part of, his or her contribution and that any derivative works of this contribution prepared by the W3C shall be solely owned by the W3C. Furthermore, the Task Force Participant understands that W3C will be able to exercise all rights as a copyright owner of Task Force Participant's contribution, including enforcement against infringers without additional agreement or notice.\n\nNothing in this agreement restricts the Task Force Participant from using their individual contributions as they wish, even if those have later been amalgamated into joint works. Where W3C releases materials under a permissive license such as the W3C Software License or CC-BY, nothing in this agreement should be read to restrict the Task Force Participant from exercising the permissions granted by that license. The Task Force Participant represents that they are legally entitled to grant the above license. If their employer(s) have rights to intellectual property that the Task Force Participant creates that includes the contributions, they represent that they have received permission to make contributions on behalf of that employer or that the employer has waived such rights for the contributions to W3C.\n\n\n## Decency\n\nThe Task Force Participant will participate in the W3C Group in a decent way. Task Force Participants will refrain from defaming, harassing or otherwise offending other participants. The [Section 3.1 of the Process Document](https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#ParticipationCriteria) applies, as does the W3C [Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/).\n\nThe Task Force Participant will refrain from sending unsolicited commercial messages to W3C mailing-lists and other promotional activities for personal matters or for third parties. This is especially required from Task Force Participants sending messages to public W3C Groups.\n",
      "readme": "# Tibetan Layout Task Force\n\nThis group is planned, but not yet active. It will exist to explore gaps and requirements for support of languages using the Tibetan script on the Web and in eBooks.\n\nIt aims to address the problem that experts often don't know how to tell the W3C what problems exist for support of their script on the Web, and the W3C often doesn't know how to contact people who can help when questions arise.\n\nSome experts may go a step further, and contribute to a gap-analysis or requirements document.\n\nTopics for discussion are suggested by [the gap-analysis template](http://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/templates/gap-analysis/gap-analysis_template.html). This work feeds into the [language matrix](http://w3c.github.io/typography/gap-analysis/language-matrix.html) which gives an overview of languages needing attention.\n\n### Documents\n- [Tibetan Layout Requirements](https://w3c.github.io/tlreq/)\n\n### Feedback\nPlease use the [GitHub issue list](https://github.com/w3c/tlreq/issues) to report issues for language support, for discussions, and to send feedback about documents.\n\n### Following\nRather than just 'Watch' this repository, it is best to subscribe to the [public-i18n-tibetan](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-i18n-tibetan/) mailing list. That list is notified once a day (in digest form) about not only changes to this repository, but also about other W3C Working Group issues related to the traditional Tibetan writing systems. (Please use github issues rather than the mailing list to send feedback.)  Meeting minutes are also sent to public-i18n-mongolian.\n\nYou can find a list of open issues, including those from W3C Working Groups, on the [Layout Tracker](http://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/textlayout/?filter=tibetan) page. (That link applies an `tibetan` filter.)\n\n### Contributing\n\nAll contributors should read and agree with [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/w3c/tlreq/blob/gh-pages/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nGroup _members_ are expert contributors who participate actively in producing the work of the group, regularly contributing text and advice to create the outputs, and participating in meetings.

Each feature is described in prose to explain its relevance to the theme of the roadmap. From that prose, the framework generates tables (one per section) summarizing the standardization and implementation status of the specification(s) that define(s) the said feature.\n\nA given roadmap is expected to contain one or more of the following sections describing the high-level status of the features described in the section:\n* *Well-deployed technologies* are technologies that are finished or nearly finished (e.g. CR and beyond in the W3C Rec track) and that have already found significant adoption among implementations;\n* *Technologies in progress* list features that have already started their standardization track progress;\n* *Exploratory work* groups features described in specifications prior to their proper standardization work;\n* *Features not covered by ongoing work* identify functionalities that are known to be needed for some use cases, but that no existing specification adequately covers\n* *Discontinued features* point out attempts to develop a feature that was deemed useful at a point in time, but that was stopped for some reason, or that led to some alternative proposal.\n\nMultiple roadmaps can be associated in a single **multi-page roadmap** with a front index page that links to individual roadmap pages. The framework generates a navigation menu in each individual roadmap page to navigate between them.\n\nIn short, the goal of the framework is to allow roadmap authors to focus on the prose that describes features that compose the roadmap, the framework taking care of adding implementation data for each feature that composes the roadmap and of formatting the result, including providing means for users to navigate between pages.\n\nWhile the pages are generated dynamically in the browser, it is likely preferable to publish exported versions of the roadmaps since the framework has not been optimized for performance.\n\n## Adding a feature to a roadmap\n\nA **feature** is roughly speaking a piece of technology that the target audience of the document would recognize as something they need to build the product they are interested in.\n\nFor the 3 first categories of features described above, a feature comes with one or more specifications that covers it. The process to add a feature to a roadmap or add a specification to an existing feature is as follows:\n* a feature is defined in an encompassing HTML element (typically `<p>` or `<div>`) by adding a `data-feature` attribute to it with the name of the feature as its value. For instance, `<p data-feature='Video capture'></p>` will serve as the container for the prose describing the said feature and the specs that cover it\n* each spec that provides the hook for the said feature needs to be listed in that container element with a `<a>` tag containing a `data-featureid` attribute, whose value is a shortname for the specification that refers to the JSON file described below, possibly completed with a `/` and the name of the feature of interest within that specification. For instance, adding `<a data-featureid='getusermedia'>the Media Capture and Streams API</a>` to the paragraph above indicates that the specification described by the `getusermedia.json` file provides a way to implement the \"video capture\" feature. A `data-linkto` attribute may be added and set to `ED` to tell the framework to link to the Editor's Draft (instead of to the latest published version on /TR/).\n* the [data](data/) directory contains a JSON file that describes the various specifications that provides the hooks relevant to the various features; that JSON file follows a [format described below](#json-format-for-describing-specifications).\n\n## JSON format for describing specifications\n\nEach specification is described by a JSON object that will allow retrieving information about the standardization status of the spec and its level of implementation in browsers. Note the framework will automatically generate an empty data file when it does not exist for W3C specs (see [Generate content locally](#generate-content-locally) for details), allowing authors to reference a W3C spec to start with without having to worry about creating the data file.\n\nThat JSON object is stored in a file in the [data](data/) directory, whose name is then used to refer to the said specification from relevant features.\n\nDepending on the advancement of the underlying specification, the JSON object can have the following properties:\n* `url`: should point to the URL of the latest version of the specification. This URL will be used to collect additional data about the spec (standardization status, Working Groups that produce it, editors draft, etc) and as target of links that reference the feature. URL may contain a fragment to point to a specific section in a specification. If the `url` property is not specified, the framework assumes that the underlying specification is a W3C specification,  that the filename is its short name, and that the URL of the spec is `https://www.w3.org/TR/[filename]/`.\n* `impl`: for specifications for which browser implementations are expected, the `impl` property explains where to look for implementation info. Described below in [Describing implementation status](#describing-implementation-status).\n* `polyfills`: for specifications for which there are polyfills available that would be worth reporting, the `polyfills` property lists these polyfills. It should be an array of objects that have a `url` property that links to the polyfill's home page on the Web, and a `label` property with the name of polyfill.\n* `features`: in case the reference to the specification would benefit from being more specific than the specification as a whole, and/or in case available implementation information is more fine-grained than the spec level, the `features` property makes it possible to list features in the spec. It must be an object whose keys are an internal feature ID, and whose values are an object describing the feature with the following properties:\n  * `title`: a label for the feature. Property is mandatory.\n  * `url`: a URL to the feature in the spec. Fragments such as `#my-feature` are allowed. Property is optional.\n  * `impl`: where to look for implementation info. Described below in [Describing implementation status](#describing-implementation-status).\n* `featuresCoverage`: when features are listed in the `features` property, this property asserts whether the list of features covers the whole spec, or whether some additional features need to be specified. This information is used to compute the implementation status of a spec from the implementation status of individual features. Property is optional. Possible values are `partial` and `full`. Default value is `partial`.\n* `status`: when the specification is unknown to the [W3C API](https://w3c.github.io/w3c-api/) and to [Specref](https://www.specref.org/), the `status` property can be used to set the maturity level of the specification. Possible values are one of `ED` (Editor's Draft), `WD` (Working Draft), `LS` (Living Standard), `CR` (Candidate Recommendation), `PR` (Proposed Recommendation), `REC` (Recommendation), `Retired` (retired or obsoleted), or `NOTE` (Group Note).\n* `title`: when the specification is unknown to the [W3C API](https://w3c.github.io/w3c-api/) and to [Specref](https://www.specref.org/), the `title` property should be set to the title of the specification.\n* `edDraft`: when the specification is unknown to the [W3C API](https://w3c.github.io/w3c-api/) and to [Specref](https://www.specref.org/), or when these APIs do not know the URL of the Editor's Draft for the specification, the `edDraft` property should contain the URL of the Editor's Draft of the specification.\n* `repository`: when the repository of the specification cannot be determined automatically, the `repository` property should contain the URL of the repository that contains the source of the Editor's Draft of the specification\n* `wgs`: when the specification is unknown to the [W3C API](https://w3c.github.io/w3c-api/) and to [Specref](https://www.specref.org/), the `wgs` property should be an array of objects describing the groups that are producing the spec; each such object should have a `url` property with a link to the group's home page, and a `label` property with the name of the group.\n* `publisher`: the organization that published the specification. The framework automatically computes the publisher for W3C, WHATWG, and IETF specifications.\n* `informative`: when the specification is unknown to the [W3C API](https://w3c.github.io/w3c-api/), set the `informative` property to `true` to tell the framework that it only contains informative content or that it will be (or has been) published as a Group Note and not as a Recommendation.\n* `evergreen`: from time to time, specifications remain as drafts indefinitely but are continuously updated and can be considered stable whenever a new version is published. Set the `evergreen` property to `true` when the specification can always be used as a reference, no matter where it is on the Recommendation track.\n* `milestones`: When the [Milestone tracker](https://github.com/w3c/spec-dashboard/#milestone-tracker) does not know anything about the specification, you may set the `milestones` properties to planned publication milestones. Value must be an object whose keys are the planned maturity level (e.g. `CR`, `REC`) and whose values are the planned publication date under the form `YYYY-MM-DD`. Do not use that property for W3C specs as milestones should rather be entered in the milestone tracker!\n* `seeAlso`: a list of other resources that could be worth looking at in relation with the specification. The `seeAlso` property should be an array of objects that have a `url` property set to the URL of the resource, a `label` property set to the title of the resource, and optionally a `kind` property that specifies the kind of resource as a string. The links are rendered in the \"See also\" column. The whole list is rendered by default, the `kind` value can be used to filter resources in some cases. See [Customizing summary tables](#customizing-summary-tables) for details.\n\nHere is an example of a JSON file that describes the \"Intersection Observer\" specification:\n```json\n{\n  \"url\": \"https://www.w3.org/TR/intersection-observer/\",\n  \"impl\": {\n    \"caniuse\": \"intersectionobserver\",\n    \"chromestatus\": 5695342691483648,\n    \"webkitstatus\": \"specification-intersection-observer\",\n    \"edgestatus\": \"Intersection Observer\",\n    \"mdn\": \"api.IntersectionObserver\"\n  },\n  \"polyfills\": [\n    {\n      \"label\": \"Polyfill.io\",\n      \"url\": \"https://polyfill.io/v2/docs/features/#IntersectionObserver\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Describing implementation status\n\n*Note (March 2018): implementation status features are still being worked upon in the framework. The implementation description should remain backward compatible, but it may still evolve.*\n\nProvided the description contains relevant information, the framework can automatically retrieve the implementation status in main browsers from the following Web platform status sources: [Can I use](http://caniuse.com/), [Chrome Platform Status](https://www.chromestatus.com/features), [MDN Browser Compatibility Data](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data), [Microsoft Edge web platform features status and roadmap](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/status/) and [WebKit Feature Status](https://webkit.org/status/).\n\nTo enable this, the decription must contain an `impl` property whose value is an object with one or more of the following optional properties:\n* `caniuse`: the name of the feature in [Can I use](http://caniuse.com/) (the one that appears in the URL after `#feat=`)\n* `chromestatus`: the number used to identify features in [Chrome Platform Status](https://www.chromestatus.com/features) (the one that appears in the URL after `features/`)\n* `edgestatus`: the name used to identify features in [Microsoft Edge web platform features status and roadmap](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/status/) (the full feature title that appears in the page)\n* `mdn`: the [hierarchy of strings](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/blob/master/schemas/compat-data-schema.md#feature-hierarchies) that identifies the feature in the [MDN Browser Compatibility Data](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data)\n* `webkitstatus`: the name used to identify features in [WebKit Feature Status](https://webkit.org/status/) (the one that appears in the URL after `status/#`)\n* `other`: manually entered implementation status. See below for details.\n\nFrom time to time, platform status sources may:\n* contain implementation information about the specification but at a different granularity level, e.g. you want implementation info about the entire specification and the site only gives implementation status about a particular feature within the specification, or the opposite)\n* contain implementation information which you know is *incorrect*.\n* not contain any information about a specification at all\n\nWhen this happens, you may use the `other` sub-property to specify implementation status manually. Property value must be an array of objects that have the following properties:\n* `ua`: the user agent name (typically one of `edge`, `firefox`, `chrome`, `safari`, `webkit`)\n* `status`: the implementation status, which should be one of `shipped`, `indevelopment`, `experimental`, `consideration`, or an empty string to say \"Not currently considered\".\n* `source` (optional but recommended): a short name that identifies the origin of the information. Use `feedback` to flag information that comes from review and that should override whatever other implementation status the framework might be able to retrieve automatically for the user agent under consideration.\n* `date` (optional but recommended): the `YYYY-MM-DD` date at which that manually information was last reviewed. Keeping implementation information up to date, is difficult, and error prone. The information needs to be periodically checked and re-validated. The date is meant to track the last time when someone checked and validated the information.\n* `comment` (optional but recommended): a comment that provides contextual information, for instance to explain why the information in platform status sources should be regarded as incorrect.\n* `prefix` (optional): whether the implementation requires the use of a prefix\n* `flag` (optional): whether some flag needs to be set to enable the feature\n\nFor instance, let's say that \"Can I use\" report that a particular feature is in development in WebKit, whereas you know that the feature has not yet been considered there; and that it does not report anything on status in Edge, whereas you know from discussion with the Edge team that it is being considered, you could add:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"TR\": \"...\",\n  \"impl\": {\n    \"caniuse\": \"...\",\n    \"other\": [\n      {\n        \"ua\": \"webkit\",\n        \"status\": \"\",\n        \"source\": \"feedback\",\n        \"date\": \"2018-03-19\",\n        \"comment\": \"No public signal in WebKit for the feature, information reported by Can I Use is incorrect\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"ua\": \"edge\",\n        \"status\": \"consideration\",\n        \"source\": \"insight\",\n        \"date\": \"2018-03-19\",\n        \"comment\": \"From discussion with the Edge team, the feature is under consideration\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn the previous example, the information on `webkit` will override the information reported by \"Can I Use\", whereas the information on `edge` will not be used if \"Can I Use\" asserts that the development has started or that the feature has shipped in Edge.\n\n\n**Important:** As noted above, maintaining implementation information over time is difficult and error prone. Whenever possible, the implementation status of a particular feature should be automatically extracted from main sources, and the `other` mechanism should only be used as a fallback when implementation status is incorrect or not available.\n\n## Creating a new roadmap page or a new single-page roadmap\nStart from the following template\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n    <title>Title of the roadmap</title>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <header>\n      <h1>Title of the roadmap</h1>\n      <p>Description of the scope of the roadmap and to whom it matters</p>\n    </header>\n    <main>\n      <section class=\"featureset well-deployed\">\n        <h2>Well-deployed technologies</h2>\n      </section>\n      <section class=\"featureset in-progress\">\n        <h2>Specifications in progress</h2>\n      </section>\n      <section class=\"featureset exploratory-work\">\n        <h2>Exploratory work</h2>\n      </section>\n      <section class=\"not-covered\">\n        <h2>Features not covered by ongoing work</h2>\n        <dl>\n          <dt></dt>\n          <dd></dd>\n        </dl>\n      </section>\n      <section class=\"discontinued\">\n        <h2>Discontinued features</h2>\n        <dl>\n          <dt></dt>\n          <dd></dd>\n        </dl>\n      </section>\n    </main>\n    <script src=\"../js/generate.js\"></script>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\nIf adding to an existing roadmap, you should also edit the `toc.json` file to add a link to that new page.\n\nFor a new single page roadmap, you also need to create a `toc.json` file as described below.\n\n## Creating the index of a new multi-page roadmap\nIf you want to divide your roadmap as a multipage document, you also need to create an index page and a JSON file listing the various sub-pages.\n\nThe template for the index page is as follows:\n```html\n<!doctype html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n    <title>Title of the roadmap</title>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <header>\n      <h1>Title of roadmap</h1>\n      <p>Introduction of roadmap scope</p>\n    </header>\n    <script src=\"../js/generate.js\"></script>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\nThe template for the JSON file listing sub-pages is as follows:\n```json\n{\n  \"title\": \"Title of the Roadmap\",\n  \"discourse\": {\n    \"category\": \"Category of the discourse instance where to post suggestions for new feature (leave empty if none)\",\n    \"url\": \"https://discourse.wicg.io/\"\n  },\n  \"github\": \"https://github.com/[org]/[repo]\",\n  \"pages\": [\n    {\n      \"url\": \"subpage.html\",\n      \"title\": \"Title of the subpage\",\n      \"icon\": \"https://.../icon/to/use/in/the/index/page\",\n      \"description\": \"One line description of the scope of the subpage\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe following settings may be added to the `toc.json` file to generate the appropriate Document Metadata section near the top of the index page:\n* `github`: The URL of the GitHub repository that contains the source of the roadmap. If specified, that URL adds a few links to the repository, the issue tracker and the commit history. That URL is also used to compute the URL of the Editor's Draft, unless already specified through the `edDraft` setting.\n* `edDraft`: The URL of the Editor's Draft. If not specified, the framework will try to compute it from the `github` setting.\n* `thisVersion`: The URL of this document. If not specified, the framework will use the Editor's Draft URL or the current URL is the URL of the Editor's Draft is unknown.\n* `publishedVersion`: The URL of the latest published version. Generates a \"Latest Published Version\" link.\n* `previousVersion`: The URL of the previous published version. Generates a \"Previous Version\" link.\n* `publishDate`: The date of the publication, following a `YYYY-MM` format. Generates a subheading under the page's title with the date.\n* `linkto`: By default, specs referenced in the prose link to the latest published version of the spec in /TR/. Set this property to `ED` to force all links in the prose to target the Editor's Draft version instead. Note this setting does not affect summary tables. Use [custom summary tables](#customizing-summary-tables) to change that setting in each table as needed.\n* `tables`: Custom summary tables, see [Customizing summary tables](#customizing-summary-tables))\n\nThe above settings may also be passed to the page as query string parameters, which can be useful to generate specific snapshots (in particular to pass the `publishDate` parameter). For instance, supposing the page can be served over a local HTTP server running at port 8080, you could use the following to view a \"complete\" Document Metadata section:\n\n`https://localhost:8080/mobile/?publishDate=2018-04&previousVersion=https://www.w3.org/2018/01/web-roadmaps/mobile/&publishedVersion=https://www.w3.org/Mobile/roadmap/`\n\n**Note:** this last mechanism cannot be used on pages that have already been generated, such as those published under `https://w3c.github.io/web-roadmaps/`.\n\n\n## Creating an About this document page\nIn a multi-page roadmap, it is good practice to link to an \"About this document\" page that provides useful information about the contents and status of the document. The about page is a specific page in that it does not appear in the index page along with the other pages. As such, it needs to be defined in a separate `about` property in the JSON file that lists sub-pages, as in:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"title\": \"Title of the Roadmap\",\n  \"pages\": [],\n  \"about\": {\n    \"url\": \"about.html\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe `url` property is the only mandated property to describe the about page, but note you may also provide a `title` property to force a different title in the side navigation menu (default is \"About this document\"), and an `icon` property to provide a custom icon.\n\nThe referenced file must exist. The framework defines a default \"About this document\" page whose contents you can reference using a `data-contents=\"about\"` HTML attribute. A minimal about page would be:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n    <title>About this document</title>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <header>\n      <h1>About this document</h1>\n    </header>\n    <main data-contents=\"about\"></main>\n    <script src=\"../js/generate.js\"></script>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\nChildren of the `<main>` element in the about page are automatically appended to the default \"About this document\" page. You may insert elements before existing ones or replace contents by using a `data-insertBefore` or `data-replace` attribute along with a CSS selector. For instance, the following about page would use the default one and replace the first paragraph of the Goals section (which is the second sibling in that section), add an \"Authors\" section before the \"Audience\" one, and finish the page with a \"Share the love\" section:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n    <title>About this document</title>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <header>\n      <h1>About this document</h1>\n    </header>\n    <main data-contents=\"about\">\n      <p data-replace=\"#goals p:nth-child(2)\">\n        This document brings the Web to its full potential.\n      </p>\n      <section data-insertBefore=\"#audience\">\n        <h2>Authors</h2>\n        <p>I!</p>\n      </section>\n      <section>\n        <h2>Share the love</h2>\n        <p>❤</p>\n      </section>\n    </main>\n    <script src=\"../js/generate.js\"></script>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\n\n## Customizing summary tables\n\nThe framework automatically generates and renders summary tables at the end of sections that are flagged with a `featureset` class. Summary tables contain one entry per feature mentioned in the prose of the section. The columns rendered in the summary table are also determined by the `class` attribute of the `<section>` tag. Recognized values are:\n\n- `well-deployed`: Typically used to talk about well-deployed technologies. The summary table will be composed of the following columns: Feature, Specification / Group, Maturity, and Current Implementations.\n- `in-progress`: Typically used to talk about technologies that are progressing along the Recommendation track. Same summary table as for well-deployed sections.\n- `exploratory-work`: Typically used to talk about technologies that are being incubated somewhere without any official status. The summary table will be composed of the following columns: Feature, Specification / Group, Implementation intents.\n- `versions`: Typically used to talk about specifications that convey guidelines, requirements, notes. The summary table will be composed of the following columns: Feature, Specification / Group, Maturity, and See also.\n\nRoadmap authors may customize the columns displayed and create new types of tables through the `tables` property of the `toc.json` file. That property must be set to an object indexed by the class identifier that will trigger the use of the table (e.g. `well-deployed` to override the default definition of the `well-deployed` table, or a new name to create a new type). For each type, the list of columns to render must be given in an array of objects that describe the column to render.\n\nThat object must contain a `type` property that identifies the type of column. It may also contain a `title` property to override the default column's title, and other parameters (which depend on the type of column).\n\nThe framework recognizes the following column types:\n\n- `feature` - Feature: Renders the name of the features that appear in `data-feature` attributes. A feature cell may span multiple rows.\n- `spec` - Specification / Group: Renders the spec title and the name of the group that develops it. The `linkto` property may be set to `ED` to force links in the column to target the Editor's Draft versions of the specs, instead of the specs in /TR/.\n- `maturity` - Maturity: Renders the maturity status of a spec as an icon. The list of icons is e.g. described in the [About page of the mobile roadmap](https://w3c.github.io/web-roadmaps/mobile/about.html#maturity-levels).\n- `impl` - Implementation status: Renders the implementation status of the specification in main browsers. The icons and info that get represented are e.g. described in the [About page of the mobile rodmap](https://w3c.github.io/web-roadmaps/mobile/about.html#implementation)\n- `milestones` - Milestones: Renders planned publication milestones for the specification. The information is extracted from the [Milestone tracker](https://github.com/w3c/spec-dashboard/#milestone-tracker) project, or from the specification's description. Beware though, as of June 2018, the tracker does not have nearly enough data for this column to be useful.\n- `seeAlso` - See also: Renders the list of related resources, including a link to the Editor's Draft, and a link to the repository. The exact kinds of resources to render can be specified in a `kinds` property. Default value is `all` to render all links, but the property can be set to an array of strings. Possible string values are:\n  - `edDraft`: renders a link to the Editor's Draft, when known\n  - `repository`: renders a link to the repository that contains the Editor's Draft, when known\n  - `seeAlso`: renders all resources in the `seeAlso` property of the specification\n  - some token: renders all resources in the `seeAlso` property of the specification whose `kind` property is equal to the token\n\nFor instance, to add the `seeAlso` column with all possible links to the summary table rendered at the end of well-deployed sections, and to create a new type of section for reference documents that also renders a `seeAlso` column with only the Editor's Draft and links flagged as `ref` in the definition of specifications, you may add the following to your `toc.json` file:\n\n```json\n\"tables\": {\n  \"well-deployed\": [\"feature\", \"spec\", \"maturity\", \"impl\", \"seeAlso\"],\n  \"reference\": [\"spec\", \"maturity\", {\n    \"type\": \"seeAlso\",\n    \"title\": \"Reference documents\",\n    \"kinds\": [\"edDraft\", \"ref\"]\n  }]\n}\n```\n\nWith these definitions, the `reference` table will be generated at the end of sections that have a `class` attribute set to `featureset reference`.\n\n\n## Repository branches\n\nThe source of the roadmaps is in the `master` branch. This is the default branch of the repository, and the branch against which you should be sending pull requests. Whenever content is pushed onto the `master` branch, a Travis script will run, fetch information and implementation data for all features listed in `data`, and eventually update the `gh-pages` branch accordingly.\n\nThe `gh-pages` branch is the branch published on [`https://w3c.github.io/web-roadmaps/`](https://w3c.github.io/web-roadmaps/).\n\n## Generate content locally\n\nIf you would like to visualize the contents of a roadmap locally as it would appear on the published version, you will need to:\n\n1. Create a [W3C account](https://www.w3.org/accounts/request) and a [W3C API key](https://www.w3.org/users/myprofile/apikeys) if not already done.\n2. Create a `config.json` file in the root of the repository that contains a `w3cApiKey` property with a valid W3C API key.\n3. Run `npm run all` to update information and implementation data. This should generate `.out/data/tr.json` and `.out/data/impl.json` files. It should also validate the data files, the generated files and the HTML files. Last but not least, it should generate static versions of the roadmap pages in an `.out` folder. Note you'll need Node.js v8.0.0 or above and you'll need to run `npm install` first.\n4. Browse the contents of the `.out` folder on your favorite Web browser (opening the file works fine, no need to serve the file over HTTP).\n\nThe `npm run all` script can take some time. If you want to have a more interactive way to browse updates you're making to files, you may follow these instructions instead:\n\n1. Create a [W3C account](https://www.w3.org/accounts/request) and a [W3C API key](https://www.w3.org/users/myprofile/apikeys) if not already done.\n2. Create a `config.json` file in the root of the repository that contains a `w3cApiKey` property with a valid W3C API key.\n3. Run `npm run create-missing-data` to create missing data files. Only needed if you referenced new specs.\n4. Run `npm run generate-info` to update information and implementation data. This should generate `.out/data/tr.json` and `.out/data/impl.json` files. This step needs to be run again whenever you make changes to information in the `data` folder.\n5. Serve the root folder over HTTP (any simple HTTP server should work), and browse the roadmap files over HTTP in your favorite Web browser. Refresh the content whenever you've made changes to the HTML, JS, or data files.\n\n\n## Translating a roadmap\n\n*Note (January 2018): this part should be mostly stable now, but it may still evolve based on practical experience with translating roadmaps.*\n\nThe translator needs to provide:\n\n* Translated versions of the HTML pages. See [Translating HTML pages](#translating-html-pages).\n* Translations of specification titles, feature names, group names and other labels used in the roadmap. See [Creating a `translations.xx.json` file](#creating-a-translationsxxjson-file).\n* Translations of the table of contents (the `toc.json`) file. See [Translating the `toc.json` file](#translating-the-tocjson-file).\n* The list of translations in the `toc.json` file so that the framework can generate links in the footer to switch from one language to another. See [List translations in the `toc.json` file](#list-translations-in-the-tocjson-file).\n\nTo maintain translations over time, it is wise to use Git tags to create snapshots of a roadmap whenever a significant update is needed. Maintaining the translation then becomes a matter of comparing the latest snapshot with the previous one. The translator can retrieve the ZIP that contains the HTML files to translate from GitHub.\n\n### Translating HTML pages\n\nThat is the main content that needs to be translated. A few recommendations:\n\n* Save the translation of a page `filename.html` in the same folder, under the name `filename.xx.html` where `xx` is the BCP47 language code.\n* Set the `lang` attribute of the `<html>` tag to the right value in the translated file.\n* The overall structure and tags of the HTML content should be preserved. In particular, class names, `data-feature` and `data-featureid` are all important.\n* The paragraph structure should be preserved too. Paragraphs are relatively independent from one another on purpose, so that they can be moved to different section as the maturity of the underlying technology evolves.\n\n### Creating a `translations.xx.json` file\n\nThe `js/translations.xx.json` file, where `xx` is the BCP47 language code, needs to contain the translations of all specification titles, group names, feature names and other labels used within the roadmaps that need to be translated. This file is common to all roadmaps. It should respect the following structure:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sections\": {\n    \"well-deployed\": \"\",\n    \"in-progress\": \"\",\n    \"exploratory-work\": \"\",\n    \"not-covered\": \"\",\n    \"discontinued\": \"\"\n  },\n  \"columns\": {\n    \"feature\": \"\",\n    \"spec\": \"\",\n    \"maturity\": \"\",\n    \"impl\": \"\",\n    \"implintents\": \"\",\n    \"seeAlso\": \"\",\n    \"milestones\": \"\"\n  },\n  \"implstatus\": {\n    \"shipped\": \"\",\n    \"experimental\": \"\",\n    \"indevelopment\": \"\",\n    \"consideration\": \"\"\n  },\n  \"labels\": {\n    \"N/A\": \"\",\n    \"%feature in %spec\": \"\",\n    \"Polyfills\": \"\",\n    \"Home\": \"\"\n  },\n  \"groups\": {\n    \"CSS Working Group\": \"\",\n    \"...\": \"\"\n  },\n  \"specifications\": {\n    \"CSS Animations\": \"\",\n    \"...\": \"\"\n  },\n  \"features\": {\n    \"audio element\": \"\",\n    \"picture element\": \"\",\n    \"...\": \"\"\n  },\n  \"maturity\": {\n    \"ED\": \"\",\n    \"WD\": \"\",\n    \"LS\": \"\",\n    \"CR\": \"\",\n    \"PR\": \"\",\n    \"REC\": \"\",\n    \"Retired\": \"\",\n    \"NOTE\": \"\",\n    \"REF\": \"\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe translations of section titles (`sections`), table columns headers (`columns`), implementation status (`implstatus`) and labels (`labels`) are required. Translations of group names, specification titles and feature names are optional, although recommended. The framework will default to English when a translation is missing.\n\nNote the framework will also write the English version of specification titles and of group names next to their translations in the generated tables, because the English version is often used when referring to specs and groups in Web pages, regardless of the language of the page.\n\n\n### Translating the `toc.json` file\n\nCreate a `toc.xx.json` file that follows the same structure as the `toc.json` file. The contents of the localized version will overwrite the same content in the `toc.json`. You do not need to duplicate content that does not need to change. For instance, in the following translation in French of the example JSON file listing sub-pages that appears earlier in this document, note that the URL of the Discourse instance and the URL and icon of the subpage have not been duplicated in the localized file:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"title\": \"Le titre de la feuille de route\",\n  \"discourse\": {\n    \"category\": \"Ma catégorie\",\n  },\n  \"pages\": [\n    {\n      \"title\": \"Titre de la sous-page\",\n      \"description\": \"Une courte description de la sous-page\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### List translations in the `toc.json` file\n\nTo add links between translations in the footer of each page, the framework needs to know which translations are available. You should add the list in a `translations` key in the `toc.json` file, for instance:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"title\": \"Title of the Roadmap\",\n  \"discourse\": {...},\n  \"pages\": [...],\n  \"translations\": [\n    {\n      \"title\": \"Français\",\n      \"lang\": \"fr\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"title\": \"English\",\n      \"lang\": \"en\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"title\": \"中文\",\n      \"lang\": \"zh\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe list of translations only needs to appear in the `toc.json` file, and does not need to appear in the localized `toc.xx.json` files.\n",

      "readme": "# Apiary\n\n![Logo](https://w3c.github.io/apiary/logo.svg)\n\nApiary is a simple JavaScript library to leverage the W3C API.\nThis library is intended to be used from W3C pages: group pages, personal pages, etc.\nWith Apiary, you can inject data that is retrieved using the W3C API, in a declarative way using *placeholders*.\nExamples are also provided.\n\nRefer to [the W3C API](https://github.com/w3c/w3c-api) and its documentation for details\n\\[[overview](https://w3c.github.io/w3c-api/); [reference](https://api.w3.org/doc)\\].\n\n## Live examples\n\n* [Group page](https://w3c.github.io/apiary/examples/group.html)\n* [User page](https://w3c.github.io/apiary/examples/user.html)\n\n## Getting started\n\n### Include the library\n\nInclude [Apiary](apiary.js) in your page:  \n```html\n<script src=\"//w3c.github.io/apiary/apiary.js\"></script>\n```\n\n### Add your API key\n\nSpecify your W3C API key, adding a `data-apiary-key` attribute to the HTML element, eg:  \n```html\n<html data-apiary-key=\"abc123def456\">\n```\n(You can get an API key very easily; refer to [the documentation](https://w3c.github.io/w3c-api/#apikeys).\nThe examples provided here work with a public API key that is registered to test Apiary only; don't try to use it elsewhere.)\n\n### Specify an entity ID\n\nSpecify the ID of the *entity* you want, adding a `data-apiary-*` attribute to a container element, eg:  \n```html\n<main data-apiary-group=\"68239\">\n```\n\n### Add placeholders\n\nFinally, add *placeholders* wherever you want real data about that *entity*, eg:  \n```html\nThe chairs of this group are: <span data-apiary=\"chairs\"></span>.\n```\n\n## Reference\n\nThe container element should have *one* of these *data-apiary-&#42;* attributes, and its value should be a valid ID:\n* `data-apiary-group`\n* `data-apiary-user` (use [the **user hash**](https://api.w3.org/doc#get--users-%7Bhash%7D))\n\nA placeholder is any element with a `data-apiary` attribute.\nBear in mind that a new chunk of DOM will be inserted there; whatever that placeholder contains will be lost.\nWe recommend that you have something in there giving users a hint that data is being loaded dynamically.\nFor example:\n```html\n<div data-apiary=\"chairs\">[Loading…]</div>\n```\n\nFor consistency (and to adhere to the [POLA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment)),\nthe suffix part of these placeholders is equal to [the object keys returned by the API](https://api.w3.org/doc).\n\nThe additional class `apiary` in the example files is ignored by Apiary itself but you may wish to include it anyway to all placeholders in your documents for easier CSS styling.\n\n## Hacking Apiary\n\nFind the developer documentation [under `doc/`](https://w3c.github.io/apiary/doc/Apiary.html).\n\nTo regenerate the documentation:\n\n```bash\n$ sudo npm install -g jsdoc\n$ jsdoc ./apiary.js --destination ./doc/ --access all --encoding utf8 --verbose\n```\n\n## Credits\n\nCopyright © 2015&ndash;2017 [World Wide Web Consortium](http://www.w3.org/)\n\nThis project is licensed [under the terms of the MIT license](LICENSE.md).\n"

By committing here, you agree to that licensing of your contributions.\n\nIf you are not the sole contributor to a contribution (pull request), please identify all contributors in the pull request comment.\n\nTo add a contributor (other than yourself, that's automatic), mark them one per line as follows:\n\n```\n+@github_username\n```\n\nIf you added a contributor by mistake, you can remove them in a comment with:\n\n```\n-@github_username\n```\n\nIf you are making a pull request on behalf of someone else but you had no part in designing the feature, you can remove yourself with the above syntax.\n\n\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright is a very important part of standardization activities. It allows the standards development organization to maintain vendor neutral control over a specification, and thus protect the consensus found within a Working Group.\n\nIn the course of the development of materials within the W3C, Task Force Participants will make contributions. Those contributions will be integrated into the jointly developed work thus creating shared copyright on the Task Force Participant's contribution. Most W3C Specifications contain a section with acknowledgement of contributions.\n\nTask Force Participants grant to the W3C a perpetual, nonexclusive, royalty-free, world-wide right and license under any Task Force Participant's copyrights on his or her contributions, to copy, publish and distribute the contribution under a license of W3C's choosing. Additionally, the Task Force Participant grants a right and license of the same scope to any derivative works prepared by the W3C and based on, or incorporating all or part of, his or her contribution and that any derivative works of this contribution prepared by the W3C shall be solely owned by the W3C. Furthermore, the Task Force Participant understands that W3C will be able to exercise all rights as a copyright owner of Task Force Participant's contribution, including enforcement against infringers without additional agreement or notice.\n\nNothing in this agreement restricts the Task Force Participant from using their individual contributions as they wish, even if those have later been amalgamated into joint works. Where W3C releases materials under a permissive license such as the W3C Software License or CC-BY, nothing in this agreement should be read to restrict the Task Force Participant from exercising the permissions granted by that license. The Task Force Participant represents that they are legally entitled to grant the above license. If their employer(s) have rights to intellectual property that the Task Force Participant creates that includes the contributions, they represent that they have received permission to make contributions on behalf of that employer or that the employer has waived such rights for the contributions to W3C.\n\n\n## Decency\n\nThe Task Force Participant will participate in the W3C Group in a decent way. Task Force Participants will refrain from defaming, harassing or otherwise offending other participants. The [Section 3.1 of the Process Document](https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#ParticipationCriteria) applies, as does the W3C [Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/).\n\nThe Task Force Participant will refrain from sending unsolicited commercial messages to W3C mailing-lists and other promotional activities for personal matters or for third parties. This is especially required from Task Force Participants sending messages to public W3C Groups.\n",
      "readme": "# Arabic Layout Task Force\n\nThis group exists to explore gaps and requirements for support of Arabic and Persian languages on the Web and in eBooks.\n\nIt aims to address the problem that experts often don't know how to tell the W3C what problems exist for support of their script on the Web, and the W3C often doesn't know how to contact people who can help when questions arise.\n\nSome experts may go a step further, and contribute to a gap-analysis or requirements document.\n\nTopics for discussion are suggested by [the gap-analysis template](http://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/templates/gap-analysis/gap-analysis_template.html). This work feeds into the [language matrix](http://w3c.github.io/typography/gap-analysis/language-matrix.html) which gives an overview of languages needing attention.\n\n### Documents\n- [Arabic & Persian Gap Analysis](https://w3c.github.io/alreq/gap-analysis/)\n- [Text Layout Requirements for the Arabic Script](https://w3c.github.io/alreq/)\n- [Glossary source](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nSxYKQm_mKroCmxU4fyJ-g70Eo1_mF89yHZg8YNOuzc/edit#gid=0) (temporary Google spreadsheet)\n\n### Feedback\nPlease use the [GitHub issue list](https://github.com/w3c/alreq/issues) to report issues for language support, for discussions, and to send feedback about documents.\n\n### Following\nRather than just 'Watch' this repository, it is best to subscribe to the [public-i18n-arabic](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-i18n-arabic/) mailing list. That list is notified once a day (in digest form) about not only changes to this repository, but also about other W3C Working Group issues related to the Arabic writing systems. (Please use github issues rather than the mailing list to send feedback.)  Meeting minutes are also sent to public-i18n-arabic.\n\nYou can find a list of open issues, including those from W3C Working Groups, on the [Layout Tracker](http://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/textlayout/?filter=arabic) page. (That link applies an `arabic` filter.)\n\n### Contributing\n\nAll contributors should read and agree with [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nGroup _members_ are expert contributors who participate actively in producing the work of the group, regularly contributing text and advice to create the outputs, and participating in meetings. For more information about becoming a task force member contact [Richard Ishida](mailto:ishida@w3.org). We welcome participation requests.\n\n### Links\n- [Issue tracker](http://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/textlayout/?filter=arabic)\n- [Github issues](https://github.com/w3c/alreq/issues)\n- [Home Page](https://w3c.github.io/alreq/homepage/)\n- [Charter](http://w3c.github.io/alreq/charter/)\n- [Action tracker](https://www.w3.org/International/groups/arabic-layout/track/actions/open)\n- [Writing i18n tests](https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/wiki/Writing-i18n-tests)\n- [Practical tips for task forces](https://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/guidelines/process.html) (See also the github and editorial guidelines below)\n- [Meeting info](https://www.w3.org/2017/07/alreq-meeting-info.html)\n- [Mail archive](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-i18n-arabic/)\n- Contacts: Shervin Afshar, Behnam Esfahbod, [Richard Ishida](mailto:ishida@w3.org)\n\n### Links for editors\nIf you edit a document, you should be familiar with and use the following:\n\n- [Github guidelines for working with i18n documents](http://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/guidelines/github)\n- [Editorial guidelines for working with i18n documents](http://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/guidelines/editing)\n\nThe following templates are available:\n- [Gap analysis template](http://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/templates/gap-analysis/gap-analysis_template.html)\n- [Requirements document template](http://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/templates/lreq_doc/gap-analysis_template.html)\n\n### Links to background information\nThe following information describes work going on at the W3C to support languages on the Web.\n- [Language support heatmap](http://w3c.github.io/typography/gap-analysis/language-matrix.html)\n- [Analysing support for text layout on the Web](https://github.com/w3c/i18n-discuss/wiki/Analysing-support-for-text-layout-on-the-Web)\n- [Overview of language enablement work in progress](https://www.w3.org/International/layout)\n- [Setting up a Gap Analysis Project](https://github.com/w3c/typography/wiki/Setting-up-a-Gap-Analysis-Project)\n- [Internationalization Sponsorship Program](https://www.w3.org/International/sponsorship/)\n",

It allows the standards development organization to maintain vendor neutral control over a specification, and thus protect the consensus found within a Working Group.\n\nIn the course of the development of materials within the W3C, Task Force Participants will make contributions. Those contributions will be integrated into the jointly developed work thus creating shared copyright on the Task Force Participant's contribution. Most W3C Specifications contain a section with acknowledgement of contributions.\n\nTask Force Participants grant to the W3C a perpetual, nonexclusive, royalty-free, world-wide right and license under any Task Force Participant's copyrights on his or her contributions, to copy, publish and distribute the contribution under a license of W3C's choosing. Additionally, the Task Force Participant grants a right and license of the same scope to any derivative works prepared by the W3C and based on, or incorporating all or part of, his or her contribution and that any derivative works of this contribution prepared by the W3C shall be solely owned by the W3C. Furthermore, the Task Force Participant understands that W3C will be able to exercise all rights as a copyright owner of Task Force Participant's contribution, including enforcement against infringers without additional agreement or notice.\n\nNothing in this agreement restricts the Task Force Participant from using their individual contributions as they wish, even if those have later been amalgamated into joint works. Where W3C releases materials under a permissive license such as the W3C Software License or CC-BY, nothing in this agreement should be read to restrict the Task Force Participant from exercising the permissions granted by that license. The Task Force Participant represents that they are legally entitled to grant the above license. If their employer(s) have rights to intellectual property that the Task Force Participant creates that includes the contributions, they represent that they have received permission to make contributions on behalf of that employer or that the employer has waived such rights for the contributions to W3C.\n\n\n##Decency\n\nThe Task Force Participant will participate in the W3C Group in a decent way. Task Force Participants will refrain from defaming, harassing or otherwise offending other participants. The [Section 3.1 of the Process Document](https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#ParticipationCriteria) applies, as does the W3C [Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/).\n\nThe Task Force Participant will refrain from sending unsolicited commercial messages to W3C mailing-lists and other promotional activities for personal matters or for third parties. This is especially required from Task Force Participants sending messages to public W3C Groups.\n",
      "readme": "# Ethiopic Layout Task Force\n\nThis group exists to explore gaps and requirements for support of languages using the Ethiopic script on the Web and in eBooks.\n\nIt aims to address the problem that experts often don't know how to tell the W3C what problems exist for support of their script on the Web, and the W3C often doesn't know how to contact people who can help when questions arise.\n\nSome experts may go a step further, and contribute to a gap-analysis or requirements document.\n\nTopics for discussion are suggested by [the gap-analysis template](http://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/templates/gap-analysis/gap-analysis_template.html). This work feeds into the [language matrix](http://w3c.github.io/typography/gap-analysis/language-matrix.html) which gives an overview of languages needing attention.\n\n### Documents\n- [Ethiopic Gap Analysis](https://w3c.github.io/elreq/gap-analysis/)\n- [Ethiopic Layout Requirements (ED)](https://w3c.github.io/elreq/) ([FPWD](https://www.w3.org/TR/elreq/))\n\n### Feedback\nPlease use the [GitHub issue list](https://github.com/w3c/elreq/issues) to report issues for language support, for discussions, and to send feedback about documents.\n\n### Following\nRather than just 'Watch' this repository, it is best to subscribe to the [public-i18n-ethiopic](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-i18n-ethiopic/) mailing list. That list is notified once a day (in digest form) about not only changes to this repository, but also about other W3C Working Group issues related to the Ethiopic writing systems. (Please use github issues rather than the mailing list to send feedback.)  Meeting minutes are also sent to public-i18n-ethiopic.\n\nYou can find a list of open issues, including those from W3C Working Groups, on the [Layout Tracker](http://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/textlayout/?filter=ethiopic) page. (That link applies an `ethiopic` filter.)\n\n### Contributing\n\nAll contributors should read and agree with [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/w3c/hlreq/blob/gh-pages/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nGroup _members_ are expert contributors who participate actively in producing the work of the group, regularly contributing text and advice to create the outputs, and participating in meetings.

Nothing will work without it. ***NOTE***: this library does not support\nkeys that were created with a list of origins. You should generate a key with no list of domains.\n\nThis gives you a client instance that's immediately ready to work. You then chain some methods to\nspecify what you want to get, and fetch with a callback. For example:\n\n```js\nvar handler = function (err, data) {\n    if (err) return console.error(\"[ERROR]\", err);\n    console.log(data);\n};\n\n// just list all the groups\nw3capi.groups()\n   .fetch(handler);\n\n// get the editors for a specific version of a specification\nw3capi.specification(\"SVG11\")\n   .version(\"20030114\")\n   .editors\n   .fetch(handler);\n```\n\nIf you are familiar with the W3C API you know that it supports paging. This library hides that fact\nand when it sees a paged list of results it *always* fetches the whole set. Typically that is a\nvery reasonable number of items.\n\n### `fetch([options], cb)`\n\nAll queries end with a call to `fetch()`. You can pass `{ embed: true }` as an option if you with\nfor the returned value to embed some of the content from the API (this matches `?embed=true`). At\nthis point that is the only option. You can do without the `options` altogether.\n\nThe `cb` receives the typical `err` and `data` parameters.\n\n### Specifications\n\nUsage summary:\n\n```js\nw3capi.specifications().fetch()\nw3capi.specification(\"SVG\").fetch()\nw3capi.specification(\"SVG\").versions().fetch()\nw3capi.specification(\"SVG\").version(\"19991203\").fetch()\nw3capi.specification(\"SVG\").version(\"19991203\").deliverers().fetch()\nw3capi.specification(\"SVG\").version(\"19991203\").editors().fetch()\nw3capi.specification(\"SVG\").version(\"19991203\").successors().fetch()\nw3capi.specification(\"SVG\").version(\"19991203\").predecessors().fetch()\nw3capi.specification(\"SVG11\").latest().fetch()\nw3capi.specification(\"SVG\").superseded().fetch()\nw3capi.specification(\"SVG11\").supersedes().fetch()\n```\n\nYou can list all specifications, or get a single one using its shortname. For a given specification,\nyou can list its versions and for a given version its editors and deliverers (the groups who shipped\nit), as well as which versions were the previous or next. You can know which specification\nsupersedes or was superseded by which other. You can use `latest()` to get the latest version\nwithout having to list them.\n\n### Groups and charters\n\nUsage summary:\n\n```js\nw3capi.groups().fetch()\nw3capi.group(54381).fetch()\nw3capi.group(54381).chairs().fetch()\nw3capi.group(54381).services().fetch()\nw3capi.group(54381).specifications().fetch()\nw3capi.group(54381).teamcontacts().fetch()\nw3capi.group(54381).users().fetch()\nw3capi.group(54381).charters().fetch()\nw3capi.group(46884).charter(89).fetch()\nw3capi.group(46884).participations().fetch()\n```\n\nYou can list all groups or get a specific one by its ID (this is the same ID used in IPP, if you're\nfamiliar with that — also the same used in ReSpec for the group). There are several sublists that\ncan be obtained, that are hopefully self-explanatory. The charters can be listed, and a specific\ncharter can be fetched given its ID (an opaque number).\n\n### Users\n\nUsage summary:\n\n```js\nw3capi.user(\"ivpki36ou94oo08osswccs80gcwogwk\").fetch()\nw3capi.user({type: \"github\", id: \"1479073\"}).fetch()\nw3capi.user(\"ivpki36ou94oo08osswccs80gcwogwk\").affiliations().fetch()\nw3capi.user(\"ivpki36ou94oo08osswccs80gcwogwk\").groups().fetch()\nw3capi.user(\"ivpki36ou94oo08osswccs80gcwogwk\").participations().fetch()\nw3capi.user(\"ivpki36ou94oo08osswccs80gcwogwk\").specifications().fetch()\n```\n\nUsers cannot be listed, and the ID used to fetch them is an opaque identifier (not the ID used\ninternally in the system so as to make it harder to slurp them all in). Alternatively, users can be fetched by their known 3rd-party account id (assuming they have been connected from the user profile). Various sublists can be\nobtained.\n\n### Functions\n\nUsage summary:\n\n```js\nw3capi.functions().fetch()\nw3capi.function(109).fetch()\nw3capi.function(109).services().fetch()\nw3capi.function(109).users().fetch()\n```\n\nFunctions are an organisational structure internal to the W3C, of little interest to the outside world.\n\n### Services\n\nUsage summary:\n\n```js\nw3capi.services(2).fetch()\nw3capi.services(2).groups().fetch()\n```\n\nServices model tools that groups (or functions) can use, such as IRC, a bug tracker, a mailing list,\netc. At this point in time, the services database isn't well-maintained but it could become more\nuseful in future.\n\n### Affiliations\n\nUsage summary:\n\n```js\nw3capi.affiliations().fetch()\nw3capi.affiliation(1234).fetch()\nw3capi.affiliation(1234).participants().fetch()\nw3capi.affiliation(1234).participations().fetch()\n```\n\n### Participations\n\nUsage summary:\n\n```js\nw3capi.participation(555).fetch()\nw3capi.participation(555).participants().fetch()\n```\n",

The focus is especially on typographic features for which information in English is hard to find, such as justification, letter-spacing, vertical text, text decoration, page layout, emphasis, etc. We want to ensure that we have captured local user needs in CSS, HTML, Timed Text, Web Payments, Web Publishing, and the many other specifications that the W3C produces.\n\n### Documents\n- [Mongolian Gap Analysis](https://w3c.github.io/mlreq/gap-analysis/) (template only, so far)\n- [Mongolian Layout Requirements](https://w3c.github.io/mlreq/) (how Mongolian needs to work on the Web & in eBooks)\n- [Mongolian variant forms](https://r12a.github.io/mongolian-variants/) (tracks work on variant encoding discussions)\n- [Encoding discussion document log](https://w3c.github.io/mlreq/variants/document-log.html)\n\n### Following\nRather than just 'Watch' this repository, it is best to subscribe to the [public-i18n-mongolian](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-i18n-mongolian/) mailing list. That list is notified once a day (in digest form) about not only changes to this repository, but also about other W3C Working Group issues related to the traditional Mongolian writing systems. (Please use github issues rather than the mailing list to send feedback. The main purpose of the public-i18n-mongolian mailing list is for notifications; meeting minutes are also sent to public-i18n-mongolian.)\n\nYou can find a list of open issues, including those from W3C Working Groups, on the [Layout Tracker](http://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/textlayout/?filter=mongolian) page. (That link applies an `mongolian` filter.)\n\n### Contributing\n\nAll contributors must read and agree with [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nPlease use the [GitHub issue list](https://github.com/w3c/mlreq/issues) to report issues for language support, for discussions, and to send feedback about documents. (Learn [how GitHub issues work](http://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/guidelines/issues.html).)\n\n**You may raise issues in Chinese, however any substantive discussions should be summarised in English at some point, so that non-Chinese speakers can follow the rationale and contribute comments.**\n\nGroup _members_ are expert contributors who participate actively in producing the work of the group, regularly contributing text and advice to create the outputs, and participating in any meetings. For more information about becoming a task force member contact [Richard Ishida](mailto:ishida@w3.org).

Then call:\n\n    npm install -d\n\nAt its root. If you want the `gh-backup` command to be available in your path, just:\n\n    npm link .\n\nand you'll be good to go.\n\n## Usage\n\n### gh-backup help\n\nPrints a help message.\n\n### gh-backup version\n\nPrints the version.\n\n### gh-backup init /path/to/configuration\n\nInitialises the backup. You need to call this the first time you get a backup running. The\nconfiguration is described below. Note that this only backs up public repositories because it only\ngets those from the GitHub API.\n\n### gh-backup update /path/to/configuration\n\nUpdates the backup. You should probably call this as a cronjob.\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe `init` and `update` commands take a configuration file. It's a simple JSON file, with the\nfollowing keys:\n\n* `dataDir`: Path to a directory in which to store information, notably all the backed up\n  repositories. Required, created for you if it doesn't exist (its parent needs to be there).\n* `pheme`: The URL to the root of the Pheme API that this should get its information from about\n  updated repositories (including trailing slash). E.g. `https://labs.w3.org/hatchery/pheme/`.\n  This is required. The reason for this is that using git to check for updates in 250+ repositories\n  can be very slow; this API call immediately lists the repositories that have been touched since\n  the last update (or init).\n* `console`: If true, will log to the console.\n* `logFile`: If set to a path, logging goes there.\n* `debug`: If set to true, extra information is dumped and only the first five init repos (or\n  udpates) are processed. Only use this to check that a code change you've made is correct, without\n  cloning gigabytes of information from GitHub.\n"

      "readme": "# Explainer: Clearing Site Data\n\n## The Problem\n\nDevelopers wish to have control over the data associated with their origins which users' browsers\nstore locally on their behalf. In particular, developers wish to take reasonable steps to protect\nusers from local attackers by ensuring that certain kinds of data are removed from a user's local\nmachine when it is no longer necessary (for example, upon signing out of an application, or upon\naccount deletion).\n\nDevelopers have direct access to a number of storage mechanisms, which makes it possible to perform\nthis kind of cleanup from JavaScript. `window.localStorage`, for example, is easily dealt with a\nsimple call to `window.localStorage.clear()`. Other storage mechanisms are trickier. Cookies, for\ninstance, exist cross-origin, might not be accessible to JavaScript, and could have path\nrestrictions that can make them quite difficult to enumerate. The browser's various caches are even\nmore difficult to poke at, as they're intentionally opaque.\n\nIt would be nice if browsers offered developers a mechanism that would give them power to remove the\ndata their applications are responsible for maintaining. Ideally, developers should be able to\nreliably ensure the following:\n\n1.  Data stored in an origin's client-side storage mechanisms like IndexedDB, WebSQL, Filesystem,\n    `self.localStorage`, `self.sessionStorage`, `self.caches`, etc. is cleared.\n2.  Cookies for an origin's host are removed.\n3.  Web Workers (dedicated and shared) running for an origin are terminated.\n4.  Service Workers registered for an origin are terminated and deregistered.\n5.  Resources from an origin are removed from the user agent's local cache.\n6.  None of the above can be bypassed by a maliciously active document that\n    retains interesting data in memory, and rewrites it if it's cleared.\n\n## The Proposal\n\nOne way to give developers the capabilities alluded to above would be to accept a server-sent\nassertion that an origin's data be cleared. This could be an HTTP response header whose value\nspecified a subset of locally stored data to be cleared:\nof:\n\n```\nClear-Site-Data: \"*\"\n```\n\nWith this kind of assertion, developers could handle a number of use cases:\n\n1.  When a user deletes their account from a given social media application, the \"Oh noes, you're\n    gone!\" page could be served along with `Clear-Site-Data: \"*\"` to clear out any and all sensitive\n    information that may have been persisted to the user's disk.\n\n2.  If a user signs out of a given application, it might do a more targeted cleanup, removing, for\n    example, photos from the disk cache, while retaining cookies with interesting user preferences\n    by serving `Clear-Site-Data: \"cache\"`.\n\n3.  In the case of catastrophic failure (perhaps an applications developers learn that their servers\n    were compromised for some period of time), developers can reduce the risk of a persistent\n    client-side XSS by clearing out local sources of data: `Clear-Site-Data: \"*\"`.\n",

      "readme": "# Modern Mailing List Archives\n\nThis repository is used to experiment with various approaches to\nmodernizing W3C's mailing list archives.\n\nGoals include:\n\n  - improve readability of default styles (incl. proportional fonts)\n  - improve usability on mobile devices\n  - provide a thread view that spans hypermail's period boundaries\n  - provide a flattened view of message threads (all messages on one page)\n  - preserve the stable URIs for messages in W3C's existing archives\n\nSee [How to contribute](#how-to-contribute) below for how to\ncontribute to this project.\n\n## Background\n\nW3C uses\n[hypermail](https://github.com/hypermail-project/hypermail) to\nmanage its archives, and while we could consider switching to\nsomething else, doing so would be quite disruptive so it seems\nunlikely to happen. (though that is [up for\ndiscussion](https://github.com/w3c/mailing-list-archives/issues/8))\n\nWe would like to improve the markup of our hypermail-generated\narchives, and possibly add a few extra features on top of that\nusing javascript libraries that can evolve independently from\nhypermail's basic output.\n\n## How to contribute\n\n### Style/markup improvements\n\nWe could use contributions in a number of areas:\n\n- [simple markup improvements to the current archives](../../issues/1):\n  HTML5, mobile-friendly; think non-controversial changes. This is\n  tracked/discussed as [issue #1](../../issues/1). Existing proposals:\n  * [a mockup of an updated message\n    page](https://w3c.github.io/mailing-list-archives/samples/message-proposal-1.html)\n    from @[gosko](/gosko)\n  * _your proposal goes here!_\n- markup to display the structure of a message thread along with\n  a message. This needs to work well with threads that contain\n  anywhere from 3 messages to 200 messages or more. (but probably\n  best to optimize for 5-20 or so)\n  [@gosko](/gosko)'s\n  [proposal](https://w3c.github.io/mailing-list-archives/samples/message-proposal-1.html)\n  includes a sample of what this might look like.\n- radical proposals for better archive UIs: in addition to simple\n  markup fixes we should consider what usability improvements we\n  can make by adding more advanced features, even if they prove\n  to be infeasible. Upvote/downvote features? Inline textareas\n  for responses? Please [submit any ideas](../../issues/) you might have!\n\n### Javascript code\n\nWe could also use some javascript code contributions to provide more advanced\nfunctionality, such as:\n\n- retrieving, parsing and displaying [a message's thread\n  structure](../../issues/2) in a useful way.\n- code to show or hide the thread structure along with a message.\n- code to switch to/from a flattened view of a message thread.\n- code to [intelligently prettify an email\n  message](https://github.com/w3c/mailing-list-archives/issues/1#issuecomment-173371579)\n  (switch to proportional font, judiciously hide quoted text,\n  allow quoted text to be toggled visible/invisible)\n- code to allow for efficient navigation of message threads\n  using simple keystrokes a la gmail.\n\n### Discuss open issues\n\nW3C staff and collaborators are welcome to give their opinions on\nthe [open issues within this repository](../../issues), including\ntopics such as:\n\n- [should we continue to use\n  hypermail?](https://github.com/w3c/mailing-list-archives/issues/8)\n- [what should archived messages look like by\n  default?](https://github.com/w3c/mailing-list-archives/issues/1)\n- [what is the best way to integrate a flattened view of message\n  threads?](https://github.com/w3c/mailing-list-archives/issues/9)\n- [should we add some kind of thread navigation\n  widget?](https://github.com/w3c/mailing-list-archives/issues/2)\n\nFeel free to [raise new\nissues](https://github.com/w3c/mailing-list-archives/issues)\nrelated to our archives as well.\n\nSee also [proposed improvements to the mailing lists archives (2002/2003)](https://www.w3.org/2002/03/archives-improvements/).\n"

Improvements welcome!\n\nSee it in action at https://www.w3.org/Tools/gh-dashboard/\n\n## Configurable views\nYou can easily create new views of github issues by creating [HTML files with Mustache templates](app/templates/), and then adding a reference to said file in the `templateUrls` in [app/scripts/main.js](app/scripts/main.js).\n\nTemplates are populated with an `issues` object that contains the list of issues and pull requests obtained from the repo via the [Github API](https://developer.github.com/v3/issues/). You can use the `filter` and `group_by` helpers to select which issues should be displayed where (see the [Issues sorted by a label-based state](app/templates/label-state.html) as an example).\n\nTemplates are expected to self-document themselves with an element of id `doc` whose content will be inserted at the bottom of the generated views.\n\nIdeally, templates should be re-usable across repos / groups, so try and make them generic if possible, and improve existing templates rather than forking them. But this is early days with this tool, so do not feel to constrained either :)\n\n## Adding a repo to the dashboard\nRepos listed in the repository selector are the ones registered in ash-nazg. The app will also happily read from any repo in the @w3c organization account.\n\n(MIT License) - Copyright (c) 2014 Ilya Grigorik\n",

      "contributing": "# Web Platform Working Group\n\nContributions to this repository are intended to become part of the World Wide Web Consortium's (W3C) [HTML Recommendation](https://www.w3.org/tr/html/), and are governed by the [W3C Patent Policy](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy-20040205/) and [Software and Document License](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/copyright-software).\n\n## Contributing\n\nBefore making your first contribution, you should read the documentation on [editing conventions and the source documents](https://github.com/w3c/html/blob/master/docs/contributing-documentation.md). You may also want to read [how the spec is built](https://github.com/w3c/html/blob/master/docs/build-documentation.md).\n\nEditorial improvements are welcome, just make a [Pull Request (PR)](https://github.com/w3c/html/pulls)! You may encounter a warning about Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) commitments if you are not a member of the W3C [Web Platform Working Group (WebPlat WG)](https://www.w3.org/WebPlatform/WG/), but this will be handled by the WebPlat WG editorial team. Specific concerns about IPR and the W3C may be found in the [Intellectual Rights FAQ](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/IPR-FAQ-20000620.html).\n\nYour concern might already be known. Before beginning work, check [the issue tracker](https://github.com/w3c/html/issues) to see if there are any existing discussions about the issue. If you want to help but are unsure how to begin, some issues are marked as [good first issues](https://github.com/w3c/html/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) or [help wanted](https://github.com/w3c/html/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22). These might be good places to start. \n\nProposals for new elements are best discussed on the [WICG Discourse](https://discourse.wicg.io/).\n\nTo make **substantive** contributions, changes that clarify or update conformance requirements, you must either participate in the W3C [Web Platform Working Group](https://www.w3.org/WebPlatform/WG/) or make a [non-member patent licensing commitment](https://www.w3.org/2004/01/pp-impl/83482/nmlc). \nThis is because the W3C Patent Policy depends on granting licenses for the [essential claims](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy-20040205/#def-essential) needed to implement the spec. A list of [previous substantive contributions](https://github.com/w3c/html/pulls?q=is%3Apr+sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Aclosed+label%3Asubstantive) can be found on the issue tracker.\n\nIf your contribution includes the work of others, please see [Contributing Documentation](https://github.com/w3c/html/blob/master/docs/contributing-documentation.md) for further guidance.\n\n## Tests\n\nFor **substantive changes**, a corresponding [web-platform-tests](https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests) PR is highly appreciated. The W3C defines a normative change as edits that affect the formal part of the Recommendation, rules that everyone must follow. **Non-substantive** changes affect supplementary information and guidance for these rules.\n\nTypically, both PRs will be merged at the same time. Note that a test change that contradicts the spec should not be merged before the corresponding spec change. If testing is not practical, please explain why and if appropriate [file an issue](https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/issues/new) to follow up later. Add the `type:untestable` or `type:missing-coverage` label as appropriate.\n\n## Language and Terminology\n\nIt may help to familiarize yourself with the specific language used by the W3C HTML Recommendation. A [full Index of terms](https://w3c.github.io/html/fullindex.html#index) used by the specification is available, as well as a [Manual of Style](https://w3c.github.io/manual-of-style/).\n",

In the\n`[branch \"master\"]` section, add a `rebase = true` line. To ensure\nthis happens for any new branches you create, add a new section like so:\n\n    [branch]\n        autosetuprebase = always\n\n\nInstalling the necessary software\n---\n\n  1. You need to have python installed on your system.\n\n  2. Install [Anolis](http://anolis.gsnedders.com/):\n\n        $ hg clone https://bitbucket.org/ms2ger/anolis\n        $ cd anolis; sudo python setup.py install\n\n     Periodically, make sure your Anolis is up to date:\n\n        $ cd anolis\n        $ hg pull\n\n     If there have been changes, update and reinstall:\n\n        $ hg update\n        $ sudo python setup.py install\n\n  3. Install [html5lib](http://code.google.com/p/html5lib/):\n\n        $ hg clone https://code.google.com/p/html5lib/\n        $ cd html5lib/python; sudo python setup.py install\n\n     Periodically, make sure your html5lib is up to date:\n\n        $ cd html5lib\n        $ hg pull\n\n     If there have been changes, update and reinstall:\n\n        $ hg update\n        $ cd python; sudo python setup.py install\n\n  4. Install [lxml](http://lxml.de):\n\n        $ sudo easy_install lxml\n\n  5. Ensure you have a clone of the [html-tools](https://github.com/w3c/html-tools/) downloaded.\n\n\nBuild the spec\n---\n\nPlease check out and follow the repository at https://github.com/w3c/html-tools .\n\n\nCherry pick commits from the WHATWG spec\n---\n\n   1. the WHATWG spec is developed in SVN at the WHATWG\n   2. there is a git clone of it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/w3c/html/tree/feature/whatwg\n   3. we cherry-pick commits from the WHATWG spec into the html spec\n\nCheckout the WHATWG spec:\n\n    $ git checkout feature/whatwg\n\nFind out commit differences to html branch:\n\n    $ git cherry master\n\nFind a commit that you want to apply, get it’s SHA:\n\n    $ git log\n\nShow the SHA commit e.g.:\n\n    $git show 56446c4536af1ec5b39bde03b402d0772625fd92\n\nCheckout the html spec:\n\n    $ git checkout master\n\nCherry pick the commit selected from before:\n\n    $ git cherry-pick -x 56446c4536af1ec5b39bde03b402d0772625fd92\n\nIf you want to edit the commit:\n\n    $ git cherry-pick -x -e 56446c4536af1ec5b39bde03b402d0772625fd92\n\nShow changes to GitHub:\n\n    $ git diff origin\n\nIf you want to abort a cherry-pick:\n\n    $ git cherry-pick --abort\n\nIf you need a merge strategy:\n\n    $ git cherry-pick --strategy=ours -x 56446c4536af1ec5b39bde03b402d0772625fd92\n\nOnly pick parts of the commit (no-commit, then add selectively):\n\n    $ git cherry-pick -n -x 56446c4536af1ec5b39bde03b402d0772625fd92\n    $ git add -i\n       r = revert a file\n       p = go through by hunk and re-patch\n       (when “>>” hit ENTER to start)\n       q = bye\n    To just commit the staged parts:\n    $ git commit\n    To reset the unselected hunks:\n    $ git checkout complete.html index source\n\nCheck if a specific commit is contained in the master:\n\n    $ git checkout master\n    $ git branch --contains 56446c4536af1ec5b39bde03b402d0772625fd92\n\nCreate a new feature branch:\n---\n[make sure your .gitconfig defaults push to upstream]\n\n    $ git checkout master\n    $ git checkout -b feature/blah\n    $ git push --set-upstream origin feature/blah\n\n\nMerging a feature branch:\n---\nYou should not use the GitHub pull request merge feature, but instead rebase locally and push (to avoid a messy merge and get a linear history):\n\n    $ git checkout feature/blah\n    $ git rebase master\n\nTest everything still works, then push to GitHub:\n\n    $ git push -f\n\nThen merge on master:\n\n    $ git checkout master\n    $ git merge feature/blah\n    $ git push\n\nIf you want to delete the branch, too, remove it both on local and GitHub (the issue with the pull request will continue to exist):\n\n    $ git branch -d feature/blah\n    $ git push origin :feature/blah\n\n"

      "readme": "\n# Web Authentication Specification\n\nThis is the repository for the W3C WebAuthn Working Group, producing the draft **\"Web Authentication\"** specification.\n\n* [The editor's copy is available at https://w3c.github.io/webauthn/](https://w3c.github.io/webauthn/), or in the [`gh-pages` branch of this repository](https://github.com/w3c/webauthn/blob/gh-pages/index.html).\n  - The current *offically-published working-draft snapshot* [is here: https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/).\n* [The build history is available at Travis-CI.org](https://travis-ci.org/w3c/webauthn/builds)\n* [W3C WebAuthn Blog](https://www.w3.org/blog/webauthn/)\n* [Web platform tests repository](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/tree/master/webauthn)\n\n# Contributing\n\nTo materially contribute to this specification, you must meet the requirements outlined in [CONTRIBUTING.md](/CONTRIBUTING.md). Also, before submitting feedback, please familiarize yourself with [our current issues list](https://github.com/w3c/webauthn/issues) and review the [mailing list discussion](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webauthn/).\n\n# Building the Draft\n\nFormatted HTML for the draft can be built using `bikeshed` (see below for instructions for `bikeshed` installation):\n\n```\n$ bikeshed spec\n```\n\nYou may also want to use the `watch` functionality to automatically regenerate as you make changes:\n\n```\n$ bikeshed watch\n```\n\n# Bikeshed Installation and Setup\n\nYou will need to have the Python tools `pygments` and `bikeshed` to build the draft. Pygments can be obtained via `pip`, but Bikeshed will need to be downloaded with `git`:\n\n```\ngit clone --depth=1 --branch=master https://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed.git ./bikeshed\npip install pygments\npip install --editable ./bikeshed\ncp -R .spec-data/* ./bikeshed/bikeshed/spec-data\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use the [Vagrant VM with `bikeshed` already installed](vagrant/bikeshed), or the [Docker image](docker/bikeshed).\n\n\n# Continuous Integration & Branches\n\nThis repository uses `.deploy-output.sh` to generate the Editor's Draft on the `gh-pages` branch upon every merge to `master`. In order to prevent failed merges during continuous integration, the formatted Editor's Draft should not be checked in to `master`, and it is in the `.gitignore` file.\n\n# Creating a new Working Draft\n\nTo build a new WD and upload it to the W3C publishing system:\n- Register as a W3C member and join the Web Authentication working group. Note down your W3C USERNAME and PASSWORD to use in the command below. If you don't remember either one, please go [here](https://www.w3.org/accounts/recover) to retrieve it.\n- Copy the url of the meeting minutes in which the working group decided to publish a new draft as the DECISION_URL to be used below\n- Make sure Bikeshed is installed locally (follow the Bikeshed Installation and Setup section above)\n- Go into the ./bikeshed directory and use git pull to update Bikeshed.\n- Run the following command to update Bikeshed's datafiles: \n```\nbikeshed update\n```\n- Edit the Bikeshed metadata to change the status from ED to WD (do not commit this change)\n- Ensure Bikeshed can compile without any error or warning by running through the following command: \n```\nbikeshed spec\n```\n- Build and upload the new draft with\n```\nbikeshed echidna --u USERNAME --p PASSWORD --d DECISION_URL\n```\n\nThe command above will create a tarball of the HTML and images, and upload to Echidna, W3C's automated publishing system. The command should return a url, thhrough which you can know whether you successfully publish the draft. Status of the request can also be tracked through the [Mailing List Archive](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-tr-notifications/). You can also use W3C API [as described in the Echidna documentation](https://github.com/w3c/echidna/wiki/How-to-use-Echidna). Note that on Windows, this will give an error about failing to delete a temporary file because it is in use by a different process. This error is harmless; it happens after the submission has completed.\n\nIf the publication through the process is unsuccessful, it's likely because of [Specbreus](https://github.com/w3c/specberus), a spec compliance checker. Echidna automatically runs through Specbreus and will reject the publication if any error is reported by Specbreus. You can run your document through [Pubrules](https://www.w3.org/pubrules/) to understand why your document is rejected. You may modify either the index.bs file or the index.html file to ensure compliance. \n\nMore often than not, you will discover the [Pubrules](https://www.w3.org/pubrules/) errors are due to bugs in either Bikeshed or Specbreus. If so, you will have to modify the compiled index.html file to bypass Echidna and use the [manual process](https://github.com/w3c/echidna/wiki/How-to-use-Echidna) to publish. While you are editing the html file to avoid errors, you should also check to ensure the document still renders correctly.  \n\nThe [manual process](https://github.com/w3c/echidna/wiki/How-to-use-Echidna) requires you to first create a tar file. To create the tar file, you need to first copy the index.html file and rename the copied file as Overview.html. This is because Echidna doesn't recognize index.html. You can then use the following command to create a tar file: \n```\ntar -cvf WD.tar Overview.html image1 image2 image3\n```\n\nThen you can run the following command curl to publish to Echidna (use the command at the same directory as your tar file): \n```\ncurl 'https://labs.w3.org/echidna/api/request' --user '<username>:<password>' -F \"tar=@WD.tar\" -F \"decision=<decisionUrl>\"\n```\n\nFeel free to contact your chair or any W3C staff when you are stucked. Overall info on echidna is here: https://github.com/w3c/echidna/wiki and here https://labs.w3.org/echidna/.\n\n# Taking meeting minutes\n\n* [Scribe instructions from the W3C Guidebook](https://www.w3.org/2008/04/scribe.html)\n* [Alternate instructions from the XML Security WG](https://www.w3.org/2008/xmlsec/Group/Scribe-Instructions.html)\n",

Use Unitas by visiting [`http://localhost/unitas/`](http://localhost/unitas/) (assuming that's where it's being served).\n   As all items are inter-linked, you can start anywhere and pretty much navigate your way to any other valid page in the system.\n   But the root page `/` is a useful entry point.\n\n### About the API key\n\n:warning: the [W3C API key](https://w3c.github.io/w3c-api/#apikeys) embedded in this project will work *from the domain `w3c.github.io` only*, as it is for\ndemonstration purposes on GitHub pages.\nMake sure you [replace it](https://github.com/w3c/Unitas/blob/master/behaviour.js#L4) with your own API to use it with `localhost://` or other origins.\n\n### Dependencies\n\nResources are loaded this way:\n\n* [`index.html`](https://github.com/w3c/Unitas/blob/master/index.html)\n  * CSS [`https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.css`](https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.css)\n  * CSS [`style.css`](https://github.com/w3c/Unitas/blob/master/style.css)\n  * JS [`https://requirejs.org/docs/release/2.3.3/comments/require.js`](https://requirejs.org/docs/release/2.3.3/comments/require.js)\n    * JS [`behaviour.js`](https://github.com/w3c/Unitas/blob/master/behaviour.js)\n        * JS [`https://w3c.github.io/node-w3capi/lib/w3capi.js`](https://w3c.github.io/node-w3capi/lib/w3capi.js)\n        * JS [`https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.2.4.js`](https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.2.4.js)\n        * JS [`https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/js/bootstrap.js`](https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/js/bootstrap.js)\n        * JS [`utils.js`](https://github.com/w3c/Unitas/blob/master/utils.js)\n\nThis cascading is far from optimal, of course.\nIt is useful during development and for debugging, though.\n\nIn production, resources will be concatenated and loaded in parallel, and minified/compressed versions of CSS/JS libraries will be used instead.\n\n## Related projects on GitHub\n\n* [w3c-api](https://github.com/w3c/w3c-api): the W3C API.\n  * [node-w3capi](https://github.com/w3c/node-w3capi): a JS client for the W3C API.\n  * [apiary](https://github.com/w3c/apiary): a simple JS library to use the W3C API in a declarative way.\n* About \\[re\\]design:\n  * [mailing-list-archives](https://github.com/w3c/mailing-list-archives): modernising W3C's mailing list archives.\n  * [wbs-design](https://github.com/w3c/wbs-design): pretiffy the WBS UI (polls and surveys).\n  * [tr-design](https://github.com/w3c/tr-design): new style sheets used by W3C technical reports in 2016.\n  * [design](https://github.com/w3c/design): templates, mockups, proposals and design-related material.\n* [midgard](https://github.com/w3c/midgard): dashboard for the dwellers of our world.\n\n## Other resources\n\n* [&ldquo;Group dashboards&rdquo; wiki page](https://www.w3.org/wiki/GroupDashboards).\n* [Modern tooling, &sect;4.2: &ldquo;dashboard&rdquo;](https://w3c.github.io/modern-tooling/#dashboard).\n\n## Credits\n\nCopyright &copy; 2016&ndash;2018 [World Wide Web Consortium](https://www.w3.org/).\n\nThis project is licensed [under the terms of the MIT license](LICENSE.md).\n"

Comment in an existing issue or raise a new issue, expressing your willingness to help and briefly summarizing the nature of your proposed resolution.\n2. An editor will confirm there are no conflicting plans and, if needed, provide guidance.\n3. Be sure you have ESLint configured as described below.\n4. Read our wiki page about [submitting pull requests](https://github.com/w3c/aria-practices/wiki/Submitting-Pull-Requests).\n5. Do some fabulous work and submit a pull request.\n\nNote: Please feel free to ask questions either through an issue or on the [Authoring Practices Task Force mailing list](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-aria-practices/).\n\n### Code conformance\n\nThis repository utilizes [linting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_%28software%29) tools to do static code analysis and ensure consistent code quality across HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each linting tool and respective code standards are documented below and in the [code guide](https://github.com/w3c/aria-practices/wiki/Code-Guide).\n\nPull requests that contain linting errors will not be merged until the errors are resolved. To make this easier, you can install and run the tools locally before pushing code. Also note that the tools for CSS and JavaScript will automatically fix many issues if you have them installed locally. To install these tools:\n\n1. Make sure that you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed, which comes with [node package manager (npm)](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)\n1. Open the directory that contains your `aria-practices` repository in a terminal\n1. Run `npm install`\n\nIt is also highly recommended that you use a code editor that supports these tools and [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/).\n\n#### HTML\n\nHTML is validated against the [NU HTML Validator](https://github.com/validator/validator).\nShould a warning or error occur because a future ARIA feature is not yet implemented, it will be added to the [the .vnurc file](.vnurc), allowing the error to pass through.\n\nRun locally:\n\n```sh\nnpm run lint:html\n```\n\n#### CSS\n\nCSS is validated by [stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) using the [stylelint-config-standard](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint-config-standard) ruleset.\n\n**NOTE**: on commit, stylelint will be run on staged CSS files. If errors are found that can be [automatically fixed with the --fix flag](https://stylelint.io/user-guide/cli/#autofixing-errors), they will be fixed and the changes committed.\n\nRun locally:\n\n```sh\nnpm run lint:css\n```\n\n#### JavaScript\n\nJavaScript is validated by [ESLint](http://eslint.org/), using [our own config](.eslintrc.json).\n\n**NOTE**: on commit, eslint will be run on staged CSS files. If errors are found that can be [automatically fixed with the --fix flag](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/command-line-interface#fixing-problems), they will be fixed and the changes committed.\n\nRun locally:\n\n```sh\nnpm run lint:js\n```\n\n### Test and fix your code\n\n1. Open a terminal window to the directory that contains the `aria-practices` repository\n1. The repository has a script defined that will test all JavaScript in the examples directory. To run it, execute the command `npm test`.\n1. Many errors can be fixed automatically with the command `npm run fix`.\n1. After running fix, test again to see what you need to fix manually.\n\nWhen the linter encounters errors, it will report them in the console.\nThe error report will contain the file name and line number, and it will\nindicate the character or place in the line that raised the style violation. To\nfix an error, satisfy the change that the violation indicates.\n\nFor example, here is an error for an invalid variable name style. Variables must\nfollow a camelCase convention.\n\n```sh\n/Users/user1/Documents/github/aria-practices/examples/slider/js/text-slider.js\n  19:8  error  Identifier 'value_nodes' is not in camel case  camelcase\n```\n\nThe error occurred in `examples/slider/js/text-slider.js`, on line 19 and the\noffending character is indicated by the number `8` after the colon. Change the\nvariable `value_nodes` to `valueNodes` in your source file to eliminate this\nerror.\n\nTo see the complete list of style rules that are applied by ESLint, review the [.eslint.json](https://github.com/w3c/aria-practices/blob/master/.eslint.json) file in the root of the project.\n\n### Editorial documentation\n\nGeneral documentation for editing ARIA deliverables is available in the\n[ARIA repository](https://github.com/w3c/aria/).\nSome of that documentation covers technical procedures not needed\nfor this specification.\n\n## How to update document snapshot\n\nNote: These instructions are for editors of the APG who have repository commit access.\n\n1. Go to the [editors draft on rawgit](https://cdn.rawgit.com/w3c/aria-practices/master/aria-practices.html)\n2. Press the ReSpec button (top right hand corner)\n3. Select 'Save snapshot'\n4. Select 'Save as HTML'\n5. Open the gh-pages branch of the `aria-practices` repository\n6. Open `index.html` in your preferred editor\n7. Overwrite contents of `index.html` with the snapshot copy you saved\n8. Commit and push changes\n9. Review changes at [GitHub pages APG snapshot](http://w3c.github.io/aria-practices/)\n",

By committing here, you agree to that licensing of your contributions.\n\nIf you are not the sole contributor to a contribution (pull request), please identify all contributors in the pull request comment.\n\nTo add a contributor (other than yourself, that's automatic), mark them one per line as follows:\n\n```\n+@github_username\n```\n\nIf you added a contributor by mistake, you can remove them in a comment with:\n\n```\n-@github_username\n```\n\nIf you are making a pull request on behalf of someone else but you had no part in designing the feature, you can remove yourself with the above syntax.\n\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright is a very important part of standardization activities. It allows the standards development organization to maintain vendor neutral control over a specification, and thus protect the consensus found within a Working Group.\n\nIn the course of the development of materials within the W3C, Task Force Participants will make contributions. Those contributions will be integrated into the jointly developed work thus creating shared copyright on the Task Force Participant's contribution. Most W3C Specifications contain a section with acknowledgement of contributions.\n\nTask Force Participants grant to the W3C a perpetual, nonexclusive, royalty-free, world-wide right and license under any Task Force Participant's copyrights on his or her contributions, to copy, publish and distribute the contribution under a license of W3C's choosing. Additionally, the Task Force Participant grants a right and license of the same scope to any derivative works prepared by the W3C and based on, or incorporating all or part of, his or her contribution and that any derivative works of this contribution prepared by the W3C shall be solely owned by the W3C. Furthermore, the Task Force Participant understands that W3C will be able to exercise all rights as a copyright owner of Task Force Participant's contribution, including enforcement against infringers without additional agreement or notice.\n\nNothing in this agreement restricts the Task Force Participant from using their individual contributions as they wish, even if those have later been amalgamated into joint works. Where W3C releases materials under a permissive license such as the W3C Software License or CC-BY, nothing in this agreement should be read to restrict the Task Force Participant from exercising the permissions granted by that license. The Task Force Participant represents that they are legally entitled to grant the above license. If their employer(s) have rights to intellectual property that the Task Force Participant creates that includes the contributions, they represent that they have received permission to make contributions on behalf of that employer or that the employer has waived such rights for the contributions to W3C.\n\n\n## Decency\n\nThe Task Force Participant will participate in the W3C Group in a decent way.

      "readme": "# Japanese Text Layout task force (jlreq) （JLReq 日本語組版タスクフォース）\n\nThis group allows a network of experts to share information about gaps and requirements for support of Japanese on the Web and in eBooks. \n\nJLReq タスクフォースは、Web や eBook で日本語をサポートするための要件と現実のギャップ (gap) や要件 (requirements) 自体について、エキスパートの人たちが知識を交換・共有するために作りました。\n\nA significant problem faced by the Web is that experts don't know how to tell the W3C what problems exist for support of their script or language, and the W3C doesn't know how to contact people who can help when questions arise. This network of experts should help to significantly reduce that problem. \n\nWeb が抱えている大きな問題の一つは、エキスパートが彼らの言語のサポートにどのような問題があるかを W3C に伝える方法を知らないこと、反対に、W3C側から聞きたいことがあっても誰に聞けば良いのかが判らないことです。このエキスパートのグループがその問題を大きく解決することを期待しています。\n\nSome experts go a step further, and contribute to the gap-analysis or requirements document, or to other documents produced by the group.\n\n一部のエキスパートの人たちは、一歩進んでこのグループが作成する成果物、例えばギャップの分析や要件定義の文書、その他の文書の作成などに貢献します。\n\nTopics for discussion are suggested by [the gap-analysis document](https://w3c.github.io/jlreq/gap-analysis/). This work supports the development of the [language matrix](https://w3c.github.io/typography/gap-analysis/language-matrix.html) which indicates hot-spots for language support. The focus is especially on typographic features for which information in English is hard to find, such as justification, letter-spacing, vertical text, text decoration, page layout, emphasis, etc.   We want to ensure that we have captured local user needs in CSS, HTML, Timed Text, Web Payments, Web Publishing, and the many other specifications that the W3C produces. \n\nこの場で主に議論すべき項目はギャップ分析文書 [the gap-analysis document](https://w3c.github.io/jlreq/gap-analysis/) に示されています。その結果は言語サポートにおける重要課題 (hot-spot) を示す [language matrix](https://w3c.github.io/typography/gap-analysis/language-matrix.html) の開発に貢献します。議論において特に重要なのは英語で情報を得ることの難しい組版の機能についてです。例えば行揃え、文字間隔、縦書き、文字の修飾、ページ構成、強調の方法、等です。W3C は W3C が開発するさまざまな仕���書、例えば CSS, HTML, Timed Text, Web Payments, Web Publishing 等が、それぞれの地域で必要な機能を必ず取り込んでいるようにしたいと考えています。\n\n### Documents（文書）\n- [Japanese Gap Analysis](https://w3c.github.io/jlreq/gap-analysis/) （日本語ギャップ分析） \n- [Requirements for Japanese Text Layout](https://w3c.github.io/jlreq/) (Editor's copy)\n- [Requirements for Japanese Text Layout](https://www.w3.org/TR/jlreq/) (Working Group Note)\n- [Requirements for Japanese Text Layout](https://www.w3.org/TR/2012/NOTE-jlreq-20120403/ja/) (Japanese version、日本語版)\n\n### Following（参加する方法）\nRather than just 'Watch' this repository, it is best to subscribe to the [public-i18n-cjk](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-i18n-cjk/) mailing list. That list is notified once a day (in digest form) about activity in this repository, but also about any activity for other W3C Working Group issues related to Japanese, Chinese and Korean. (Please use github issues rather than the mailing list to send feedback. The main purpose of the public-i18n-cjk mailing list is for notifications; meeting minutes are also sent to that list).\n\nJLReq タスクフォースに参加するには [public-i18n-cjk](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-i18n-cjk/) メーリングリストに参加するのがベストです。メーリングリストは1日1回、JLReq GitHub で起こっている議論をまとめて伝えます。W3C の他のグループで日本語、中国語、韓国語に関係する議論が行われていたらその内容も伝えます。（フィードバックを送るにはメーリングリストではなく GitHub issues を使ってください。この public-i18n-cjk リストの主な目的は通知です。会議録もこのリストに送られます）\n\nYou can find a list of open issues, including those from Working Groups, on the [Layout Tracker](http://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/textlayout/?filter=jlreq) page. (That link applies a `japanese` filter.)\n\nJLReq タスクフォースや他の Working Group の日本語に関する未解決の問題（open issues）は [Layout Tracker](http://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/textlayout/?filter=jlreq) のページで見ることができます。\n\n### Contributing（参加する方法）\nAll contributors must read and agree with [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n全ての参加者は  [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) を読み、それに同意する必要があります。\n\nPlease use the [GitHub issue list](https://github.com/w3c/jlreq/issues) to to report issues for language support, for discussions, and to send feedback about documents. (Learn [how GitHub issues work](http://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/guidelines/issues.html).)\n\n日本語に関する問題の報告、議論や文書へのフィードバックには [GitHub issue list](https://github.com/w3c/jlreq/issues) を使ってください（[GitHub issues の使い方](http://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/guidelines/issues.html)（英語））\n\n**You may raise issues in Japanese, however any substantive discussions should be summarised in English at some point, so that non-Japanese speakers can follow the rationale and contribute comments.**\n\n**GitHub issues での議論は日本語で構いません。ただし重要な議論が日本語で行われた場合は、日本語の判らないメンバーが議論を理解しコメントできるよう、適当な時点で英語での要約が必要です。**\n\nGroup _members_ are expert contributors participate actively in producing the work of the group, contributing text and advice to create the outputs, and participating in any meetings. For more information about becoming a group member contact [Richard Ishida](mailto:ishida@w3.org) or [木田泰夫 (Yasuo Kida)](mailto:kida@me.com).

      "readme": "# Long Task API\n\nLong Tasks is a new real user measurement (RUM) performance API to enable applications to measure responsiveness. It enables detecting presence of “long tasks�� that monopolize the UI thread for extended periods of time and block other critical tasks from being executed - e.g. reacting to user input.\n\n## Background\nAs the page is loading and while the user is interacting with the page afterwards, both the application and browser queue various events that are then executed by the browser -- e.g. the user agent schedules input events based on user’s activity, the application schedules callbacks for requestAnimationFrame and other callbacks etc. Once in the queue, these events are then dequeued one-by-one by the browser and executed — see [“the anatomy of a frame”](https://aerotwist.com/blog/the-anatomy-of-a-frame) for a high-level overview of this process in Blink.\n\nHowever, some tasks can take a long time (multiple frames), and if and when that happens, the UI thread is locked and all other tasks are blocked as well. To the user this is commonly visible as a “locked up” page where the browser is unable to respond to user input; this is a major source of bad user experience on the web today:\n\n* _Delayed [“time to Interactive”](https://github.com/tdresser/time-to-interactive)_:  while the page is loading long tasks often tie up the main thread and prevent the user from interacting with the page even though the page is visually rendered. Poorly designed third-party content is a frequent culprit.\n* _High/variable input latency_: critical user interaction events (tap, click, scroll, wheel, etc) are queued behind long tasks, which yields janky and unpredictable user experience.\n* _High/variable event handling latency_: similar to input, but for processing event callbacks (e.g. onload events, and so on), which delay application updates.\n* _Janky animations and scrolling_: some animation and scrolling interactions require coordination between compositor and main threads; if the main thread is blocked due to a long task, it can affect responsiveness of animations and scrolling.\n\nSome applications (and RUM vendors) are already attempting to identify and track cases where “long tasks” happen. For example, one known pattern is to install a ~short periodic timer and inspect the elapsed time between the successive calls: if the elapsed time is greater than the timer period, then there is high likelihood that one or more long tasks have delayed execution of the timer. This mostly works, but it has several bad performance implications: the application is polling to detect long tasks, which prevents quiescence and long idle blocks (see requestIdleCallback); it’s bad for battery life; and there is no way to know what caused the delay. (e.g. first party vs third party code)\n\n[RAIL performance model](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/profile/evaluate-performance/rail?hl=en#response-respond-in-under-100ms) suggests that applications should respond in under 100ms to user input; for touch move and scrolling in under 16ms. Our goal with this API is to surface notifications about tasks that may prevent the application from hitting these targets.\n\n## Terminology\nMajor terms:\n* **frame** or **frame context** refers to the browsing context, such as iframe (not animation frame), embed or object\n* **culprit frame** refers to the frame or container (iframe, object, embed etc) that is being implicated for the long task\n* **attribution** refers to identifying the type of work (such as script, layout etc.) that contributed significantly to the long task AND which browsing context or frame is responsible for that work.\n* **minimal frame attribution** refers to the browsing context or frame that is being implicated overall for the long task\n\n## V1 API\nLong Task API introduces a new PerformanceEntry object, which will report instances of long tasks:\n```javascript\ninterface PerformanceLongTaskTiming : PerformanceEntry {\n  [SameObject, SaveSameObject] readonly attribute FrozenArray<TaskAttributionTiming> attribution;\n};\n```\n\nAttribute definitions of PerformanceLongTaskTiming:\n* entryType: \"longtask\"\n* startTime: `DOMHighResTimeStamp` of when long task started\n* duration: elapsed time (as `DOMHighResTimeStamp`) between start and finish of task\n* name: minimal frame attribution, eg. \"same-origin\", \"cross-origin\", \"unknown\" etc. Possible values are:\n * \"self\"\n * \"same-origin-ancestor\"\n * \"same-origin-descendant\"\n * \"same-origin\"\n * \"cross-origin-ancestor\"\n * \"cross-origin-descendant\"\n * \"cross-origin-unreachable\"\n * \"multiple-contexts\"\n * \"unknown\"\n\n* attribution: `sequence` of `TaskAttributionTiming`, a new `PerformanceEntry` object to report attribution within long tasks. To see how `attribute` is populated for different values of `name` see the section below: [Pointing to the culprit](#pointing-to-the-culprit)\n\n```javascript\ninterface TaskAttributionTiming : PerformanceEntry {\n  readonly attribute DOMString containerType;\n  readonly attribute DOMString containerSrc;\n  readonly attribute DOMString containerId;\n  readonly attribute DOMString containerName;\n};\n```\n\nAttribute definitions of TaskAttributionTiming:\n* entryType: “taskattribution”\n* startTime: 0\n* duration: 0\n* name: type of attribution, eg. \"script\" or \"layout\"\n* containerType: type of container for culprit frame eg. \"iframe\" (most common), \"embed\", \"object\".\n* containerName: `DOMString`, container’s name attribute\n* containerId: `DOMString`, container’s id attribute\n* containerSrc: `DOMString`, container’s src attribute\n\n\nLong tasks events will be delivered to all observers (in frames within the page or tab) regardless of which frame was responsible for the long task. The goal is to allow all pages on the web to know if and who (first party content or third party content) is causing disruptions. \n\nThe `name` field provides minimal frame attribution so that the observing frame can respond to the issue in the proper way. In addition, the `attribution` field provides further insight into the type of work (script, layout etc) that caused the long task as well as which frame is responsible for that work. For more details on how the `attribution` is set, see the \"Pointing to the culprit\" section.\n\nThe above covers existing use cases found in the wild, enables document-level attribution, and eliminates the negative performance implications mentioned earlier. To receive these notifications, the application can subscribe to them via PerformanceObserver interface:\n\n```javascript\nvar observer = new PerformanceObserver(function(list) {\n  var perfEntries = list.getEntries();\n  for (var i = 0; i < perfEntries.length; i++) {\n     // Process long task notifications:\n     // report back for analytics and monitoring\n     // ...\n  }\n});\n\n\n// register observer for long task notifications\nobserver.observe({entryTypes: [\"longtask\"]});\n\n// Long script execution after this will result in queueing \n// and receiving “longtask” entries in the observer.\n```\n\n**Long-task threshold is 50ms.** That is, the UA should emit long-task events whenever it detects tasks whose execution time exceeds >50ms. \n\n### Demo\nFor a quick demo of a partial implementation, in the latest Chrome Canary (version 55.0.2867.0 or up) go to [chrome://flags](chrome://flags) and enable the flag: \"Experimental Web Platform features\".\nThen visit this link:\nhttps://w3c.github.io/longtasks/render-jank-demo.html\n\nFor a demo of long tasks from same-origin & cross-origin frames see the demo below. Interacting with the iframed wikipedia page will generate cross-origin long task notifications.\nhttps://w3c.github.io/longtasks/demo.html\n\n\n### Pointing to the culprit\nLong task represents the top level event loop task. Within this task, different types of work (such as script, layout, style etc) may be done, and they could be executed within different frame contexts. The type of work could also be global in nature such as a long GC that is process or frame-tree wide.\n\nThus pointing to the culprit has couple of facets:\n* Pointing to the overall frame to blame for the long task on the whole: this is refered to as \"minimal frame attribution\" and is captured in the `name` field\n* Pointing to the type of work involved in the task, and its associated frame context: this is captured in `TaskAttributionTiming` objects in the `attribution` field of `PerformanceLongTaskTiming` \n\nTherefore, `name` and `attribution` fields on PerformanceLongTaskTiming together paint the picture for where the blame rests for a long task.\n\nThe security model of the web means that sometimes a long task will happen in an iframe that is unreachable from the observing frame. For instance, a long task might happen in a deeply nested iframe that is different from my origin. Or similarly, I might be an iframe doubly embedded in a document, and a long task will happen in the top-level browsing context. In the web security model, I can know from which direction the issue came, one of my ancestors or descendants, but to preserve the frame origin model, we must be careful about pointing to the specific container or frame.\n\nCurrently the TaskAttributionTiming entry in `attribution` is populated with \"script\" work (in the future layout, style etc will be added). The container or frame implicated in `attribution` should match up with the `name` as follows:\n\n| value of `name`         | frame implicated in `attribution`| \n| ----------------------- |:-------------------------:| \n| self                    | empty                     | \n| same-origin-ancestor    | same-origin culprit frame |\n| same-origin-descendant  | same-origin culprit frame | \n| same-origin             | same-origin culprit frame | \n| cross-origin-ancestor   | empty                     |\n| cross-origin-descendant | first cross-origin child frame between my own frame and culprit frame|\n| cross-origin-unreachable| empty                     |\n| multiple-contexts       | empty                     |\n| unknown                 | empty                     |\n\n\n## Privacy & Security\nLong Tasks API surfaces long tasks greater than a threshold (50ms) to developers via Javascript (Performance Observer API). It includes origin-safe attribution information about the source of the long task.\nThere is a 50ms threshold for long tasks. Together this provides adequate protection against security attacks against browser.\n\nHowever, privacy related attacks are possible, while the API doesn’t introduce any new privacy attacks, it could expedite existing privacy attacks. If this were to become an concern, additional mitigations can be implemented to address this such as dropping \"culprit\" after a per-target origin threshold is exceeded, or limiting to 10 origins per minute etc.\n\nDetailed Security & Privacy doc is here:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1tIMI1gau_q6X5EBnjDNiFS5NWV9cpYJ5KKA7xPd3VB8/edit#\n\n## V2 API Sketch\nSee: https://docs.google.com/document/d/125d69JAC7nyx-Ob0a9Z31d1uHUGu4myYQ3os9EnGfdU/edit\n\n## Alternatives Considered\n### Why not just show sub-tasks vs. top-level tasks with attribution?\nThis API will show toplevel long tasks along with attribution for specific sub-tasks which were problematic.\nFor instance, within a 50ms toplevel task, sub-tasks such as a 20ms script execution or a 30ms style & layout update -- will be attributed.\nThis raises the question -- why show the toplevel task at all? Why not only show long sub-tasks such as script, style & layout etc that are directly actionable by the user? The top level task may contain some un-attributable segments such as browser work eg. GC or browser events etc.\n\nThe rationale here is that showing the toplevel task is good for web developers, even though they will actively consume the actionable sub-tasks such as long scripts and act on them. Over time the sub-task attribution will keep expanding, making more of the long task actionable.\nShowing the top-level task gives developers a direct indication of main thread busy-ness, and since this directly impacts the user experience, it is appropriate for them to know about it as a problem signal -- even if they cannot have complete visibility or full actionability for the entire length of the long task. \nIn many cases the developers may be able to repro in lab or locally and glean additional insights and get to the root cause. \nLong tasks provide context to long sub-tasks, for instance, a 20ms style and layout or a 25ms script execution may not be terrible by themselves, but if they happen consecutively (eg. script started from rAF) and cause a long 50ms task, then this is a problem for user responsiveness.\n\n",

Level 2 corresponds to the consensus reached within the Editing Taskforce at the end of 2016. Level 1 is a subset that was split off in early 2017, when the Chromium team announced that it would not implement the entire specifition. At this time Safari had already implemented the full specification. We also did not want to give up level 2 of the spec, because it actually resolves a lot of issues and there has been no counter-proposal to effectively solve these issues from the Android team or others. Given that Chromium team told the Editing Taskforce that it either had to release a spec with their proposed changes or they would drop the spec entirely, it was decided to split the specification in two levels.\n\nEven though the specs look somewhat similar, they have to be handled quite differently by JavaScript editors:\n\n* Level 1 gives the JS editor information about proposed changes from the user, but it makes the related DOM change be non-cancelable in many cases. The event is therefore only useful in combination with a way to roll back the DOM after the DOM change has been made, most likely a DOM-diffing library. In the case of IME, it is extra difficult to handle as DOM changes cannot be reverted before the composition has finished.\n\n* Level 2 gives the JS editor information information about the proposed changes from the user and let's the JS author cancel the changes the browser otherwise would have done. There is one exception to this and that is IME, which cannot be canceled due to various technical constraints, but events have been added before and after IME input that effectively allow the JS author to isolate IME input. A JS editor based on level 2 should therefore be implementable without including DOM-diffing libraries or rolling browser-made DOM-changes back. A test of trying to create an editor using the event was conducted by the CKEditor team in the second half of 2016 before it was implemented in browsers.\n",

      "readme": "# PerformancePaintTiming\n\nWeb developers require more information on page load performance in the wild. \nNo single moment in time completely captures the \"loading experience\". To give developers insight into the loading experience, we propose a set of key progress metrics to capture the series of key moments during pageload which developers care about.\n\nFor detailed motivation, see the [Why First Paint?](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wdxSXo_jctZjdPaJeTtYYFF-rLtUFxrU72_7h9qbQaM/edit) doc.\n\nFirst Paint (FP), is the first of these key moments, followed by First Contentful Paint (FCP). In the future, we may add additional metrics, such as First Meaningful Paint (FMP), and Time to Interactive (TTI).\n\n## Interface\nWe propose introducing the `PerformancePaintTiming` interface, extending the PerformanceEntry interface, to report the time to first paint and time to first contentful paint.\n\n```javascript\ninterface PerformancePaintTiming : PerformanceEntry {};\n```\n\nEntries will have a `name` of \"first-paint\" and \"first-contentful-paint\" respectively, and an `entryType` of `\"paint\"`. `startTime` is the `DOMHighResTimeStamp` indicating when the paint occurred, and the `duration` will always be 0.\n\n## Definition\n\n- `\"first-paint\"` entries contain a `DOMHighResTimeStamp` reporting the time when the browser first rendered after navigation. This excludes the default background paint, but includes non-default background paint. This is the first key moment developers care about in page load – when the browser has started to render the page.\n\n- `\"first-contentful-paint\"` contain a `DOMHighResTimestamp` reporting the time when the browser first rendered any text, image (including background images), non-white canvas or SVG. This includes text with pending webfonts. This is the first time users could start consuming page content.\n\n_WIP: [define processing algorithm and integration with HTML](https://github.com/w3c/paint-timing/issues/4)_\n\n---\n\nThe browser has performed a \"paint\" or \"render\" when it has converted the render tree to pixels on the screen. \n\nMore formally, we consider the browser to have \"rendered\" a document when it has updated \"the rendering or user interface of that Document and its browsing context to reflect the current state\". See the HTML spec's section on the event loop processing model – [section 7.12](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#event-loop-processing-model).\n\nThe rendering pipeline is very complex, and the timestamp should be the latest timestamp the browser is able to note in this pipeline (best effort). Typically the time at which the frame is submitted to the OS for display is recommended for this API.\n\n\n## Usage\n\n```javascript\n\nvar observer = new PerformanceObserver(function(list) {\n  var perfEntries = list.getEntries();\n  for (var i = 0; i < perfEntries.length; i++) {\n     // Process entries\n     // report back for analytics and monitoring\n     // ...\n  }\n});\n\n// register observer for paint timing notifications\nobserver.observe({entryTypes: [\"paint\"]});\n\n```\nThese entries will be buffered for the cases where PerformanceObserver is unable to register itself early enough on the page. \nFor this case paint entries can be accessed as follows:\n```javascript\n\nperformance.getEntriesByType('paint');\n```\n\n## Examples\n\nThese examples are hand annotated, based on the definitions given above.\n\n![Web page filmstrips with annotated first paint times.](filmstrip.png)\n\nSome rough bulk data can be seen [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1i0-tOtZP21m3DjBJflUJYao9-WAKwWV2p9WFlVhVivg/edit#gid=1447332636) or [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nGauGA3EvN8NBC3ErWjLd8Bz-NzmmEa6q6UP5KhfgeA/edit#gid=0). This data was collected using a somewhat different definition than we're currently using – it includes white paints in `first-paint` and only looks at text and image paints for `first-contentful-paint`.\n\n#### Why not add this to Navigation Timing?\nThis belongs outside Navigation Timing because Navigation Timing is spec'd as queueing the entry on document load end; however, FCP (or FMP in the future) may not have triggered at that point.\n",

you're not sure what transition template to use, check out our [next step finder](https://w3c.github.io/transitions/nextstep.html) to see your choices.\n\n## Further Guidance\n\n  * If you're not sure how to fill the template properly, see [Organize a Technical Report Transition](https://www.w3.org/Guide/transitions).\n  * If you need to convey Member-confidential information, start a thread on w3c-archive@w3.org and link it from your issue; lists.w3.org's access control will manage permissions. Use w3t-archive@w3.org instead for Team-confidential infos.\n  * Your WG code is your WG's preferred (unique) abbreviation: it is included in the title template to help you search for transition requests relevant to your WG and manage the official or unofficial pestering of whoever has the “ball”.\n  * Assign your editor(s) and staff contact(s) to the transition request issue to facilitate automatic pestering.\n  * Don't forget to tag/untag “Awaiting ...” so that issues show up in the appropriate to-do queues.\n  * Issues get closed once publication is complete *and* relevant announcements are posted.\n"

      "readme": "# ARIA Common Files\n\n[This is the repository for aria-common](https://github.com/w3c/aria-common). It contains files shared by several other ARIA repositories, and copied into those repositories. Note *content must be updated in w3c/aria-common*; changes made in copies are overwritten next time content from this repository is synced.\n\nResources in the common files:\n\n## Terms\n\nThe specifications share a common set of term definitions, located in [terms.html](terms.html). Add and update terms there, keeping in mind your edits will affect all specifications. To use the terms, at the place you want the terms to be included, provide the following line:\n\n```html\n<div data-include=\"../common/terms.html\" data-oninclude=\"restrictReferences\"></div>\n```\n\nThis includes the terms file and filters it to only output ones that are referenced in that particular specification.\n\n## Bibliography\n\nThe Respec processor loads a bibliography called [Specref](https://github.com/tobie/specref). This resource automatically includes most publications that have been published to the W3C Technical Reports page. While it is possible to request additions to this via pull requests, in practice to use references that are not in that database, it is easier to use a [`localBiblio`](https://github.com/w3c/respec/wiki/localBiblio). This allows the Respec configuration to load additional bibliographic entries, structured in the same way as in Specref.\n\nMany of the supplementary bibliographic entries needed for the ARIA publications are common to several specifications. Therefore the bibliographic entries are all stored in [biblio.js](biblio.js). This is loaded with the other scripts at the top of the file with the following line:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"../common/biblio.js\" class=\"remove\"></script>\n```\n\nIn the respecConfig, instead of providing the set of bibliographic entries directly, simply reference the object created by that script:\n\n```html\nlocalBiblio: biblio,\n```\n\n## Images, CSS, and Scripts\n\nThe `common` directory also contains shared images, CSS, and scripts. Some of the scripts extend the Respec formatting processor, and others are meant to be used with the final output version. When a resource is, or is likely to be, shared, put it in the common directory. Resources specific to a particular specification, including overriding CSS, can be placed in the directory for that specification. Use the same sub-directory structure of `img`, `css`, and `script` to help keep files organized.\n",

Please follow the following guidelines for the contribution workflow:\n- Fork the repository, then clone the fork.\n- Create a local branch in your fork, push commits there, then make a pull request. After the pull request is merged, the local branch can be optionally deleted.\n- Sign the commits (use e.g. `git commit -s -m \"message\"`).\n- Make commit messages specific and informative, e.g. by including issue numbers.\n- For bigger commits, the first line of the commit message should be a short summary, then after an empty line a more detailed description or rationale of the commit should follow.\n- Similarly, pull request comments should follow the same principles as commit messages.\n- For HTML files please provide a link to a rendered diff in the pull request, using the [W3C HTML diff tool](https://services.w3.org/htmldiff) for comparing two versions of the same file from different forks and branches. See an example [here](https://services.w3.org/htmldiff?doc1=https%3A%2F%2Fw3c.github.io%2Fwot-scripting-api%2F&doc2=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fdanielpeintner%2Fwot-scripting-api%2Fmaster%2Findex.html).\nNote that the tool expects the \"raw\" link to the files, for instance this file's raw link is [https://github.com/w3c/wotwg/raw/master/README.md](https://github.com/w3c/wotwg/raw/master/README.md) that resolves to [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/w3c/wotwg/master/README.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/w3c/wotwg/master/README.md), and can be obtained by clicking on the `Raw` button when the file is displayed on the github web page.)\n- Pull requests should be reviewed and approved by someone else (typically an editor), then approved and merged by an editor or chair.\n- The preferred way to merge a pull request is by creating a merge commit, or by squashing (select the option from the pull-down menu right to the merge button). To keep full history, rebase merge is fine if commits are well defined and formatted.\n\nPlease read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), about licensing contributions.\n\n## History\n\nSee the [WoT IG repository](https://github.com/w3c/wot).\n\n[WPT]: https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/\n[db]: https://www.w3.org/WoT/WG/wiki/ (TBD)\n"

That will not be the case any more, so these services are not really of use any more.**\n\n# rdfa-md-service\n\nPython modules to run the [“RDFa 1.1 Distiller”](https://www.w3.org/2012/pyRdfa/), [“RDFa 1.1 Validator”](https://www.w3.org/2012/pyRdfa/Validator.html), and [“Microdata to RDF”](https://www.w3.org/2012/pyMicrodata/) services at W3C.\n\n## Repo content:\n\n- `rdfa_md`: The relevant Python package covering both the RDFa and the Microdata branches. Put this module somewhere in $PYTHONPATH.\n- `CGI_scripts`: Python scripts that can be used as CGI entry points on a web site. These scripts are minimal; after a rudimentary checking on the incoming URI-s they dive into the functionalities in `rdf_md`.\n\nSee the [separate documentation](https://rawgit.com/w3c/rdfa-md-service/master/Doc/build/html/index.html) for the details of these.\n\n## External dependencies\n\nThe module has the following dependencies (beyond the standard Python modules)\n\n* [RDFlib](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib) which does all the heavy lifting for parsing. Use the latest release, currently 4.2.\\*.\n* [RDFLib-JSONLD](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib-jsonld) to serialize the output into JSON-LD\n* [html5lib](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/html5lib) to parse HTML\n\n### Python3\n\nThe package has not yet been tested for Python3 although, manually, the code has been written in a Python3 way; the real issue is whether the dependencies are Python3 ready or not. (Current situation: unknown for rdflib-jsonld, should be o.k. for html5lib, and rdflib must be installed separately for Python3. The rdflib issue should be solved, ie, the same code should run on both Python2 and Python3 starting with version 5.)\n\n\n## Status in January 2017\n\n The current services at W3C still rely on a different, and outdated architecture, whereby the CGI scripts called out to a full, and separate, RDFa (resp. Microdata) module that is *on top* of RDFLib. That was the right approach when the corresponding parsers had not yet been incorporated into RDFLib. It is now time to remove that separate layer. The package itself is now operational, but has not yet been tested on the W3C services. Hopefully, this will be done soon.\n"

      "readme": "# PR Build Bot\nThe PR Build Bot is a Python web application that listens to Travis CI webhooks\nand posts selections from the build logs as comments on the GitHub PR. This\nallows commenting on PRs from both trusted and untrusted branches of the main\nrepository without exposing the GitHub Personal Access Token of the commenting\nuser.\n\n## Installation\nThis bot can be installed in any number of Python server environments. wptserve\nand Flask options are described below.\n\n\n### Installation as a wptserve application\n\n[wptserve](http://wptserve.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html) is a\nserver used throughout the W3C testing infrastructure. There is currently no\nAnsible configuration for this installation type. The following general\ninstructions should get you running.\n\n#### Requirements\n- Python 2.7\n\n#### Process\n1. Install the `requests` and `pyOpenSSL` modules into your Python environment.\n  - pyOpenSSL requires a dev version of OpenSSL (e.g. `libssl-dev`)\n2. Install [wptserve](https://github.com/w3c/wptserve).\n  - Clone from GitHub\n  - Run `sudo python setup.py install` from the cloned directory.\n3. Clone this project and `cd` into the cloned directory.\n4. Configure the application for your project. See\n    [Configuration](#configuration), below.\n5. Run `python wptserve_app.py`\n  - May require `sudo` if you receive a \"Permission Denied\" error.\n\n\n### Installation on Dedicated Server with nginx as a Flask application\n\nThis installation process uses [Ansible](http://docs.ansible.com/) to configure\nthe server to use [nginx](http://nginx.org/) and\n[uWSGI](http://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to serve a\n[Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) application. It expects nginx to be able to\nuse port 80.\n\n#### Requirements\n\n- Ubuntu-like server environment\n- [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)\n- [Ansible >= 2.2.1.0](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_installation.html#latest-releases-via-pip)\n  - Note: on Ubuntu, this requires installing ansible via `pip`, not `apt`.\n\n#### Process\n\nThis is how to install the dependencies and application on a base Ubuntu 16.04\nbox. Git should come out of the box.\n\n1. Create a server instance wherever you like.\n2. Add a non-root user to own the application.\n  - `adduser prbuildbot` as root\n  - You will create a password for this user. Keep it secret. Keep it safe.\n3. Ensure the new user is able to `sudo`.\n  - `adduser prbuildbot sudo` as root\n4. Log into the server as the new user.\n5. Update apt repositories\n  - `sudo apt-get update`\n6. Install pip.\n    `sudo apt install python-pip`\n7. Upgrade pip.\n  - `sudo -H pip install --upgrade pip`\n8. Install libssl-dev.\n  - `sudo apt install libssl-dev`\n9. Install Ansible.\n  - `sudo -H pip install ansible`\n10. Fork this repository and clone it into the user's home directory.\n  - `git clone https://github.com/<your user name>/prbuildbot.git`\n  - You will be editing a file under version control, so you should create your\n    own fork and store your changes there.\n11. Configure the application for your project. See\n    [Configuration](#configuration), below.\n12. Change into the `ansible` directory and run the provisioning script.\n  - `cd prbuildbot/ansible`\n  - `ansible-playbook provision.yml`\n  - Note: this must be run from the `prbuildbot/ansible` directory, or it\n    will fail.\n  - **Note:** This does not install any of the python modules into virtual_env,\n    but at the system level. This is possible with Ansible, just not implemented\n    yet.\n\n\n## Configuration\n\nYou will need to set up a user on GitHub, get a personal access token for them,\nand set up the configuration file for the application.\n\n1. Set up a user on GitHub that you want to be the \"commenter.\"\n2. Get a Personal Access Token for that user.\n  - Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens.\n  - Click \"Generate new token\"\n  - On the creation page, name the token and give it at least `public_repo`\n    and `user:email` permissions.\n3. Set up the configuration file on the server.\n  - In the application directory: `cp config.sample.txt config.txt`\n  - Edit the config properties as necessary (see below for descriptions)\n4. Edit `log_parser.py` to parse the Travis CI job logs in whatever way you\n   require.\n  - The included `log_parser.py` includes the logic for parsing log files for\n    `w3c/web-platform-tests` as an example.\n  - You should commit this file back into your fork so that you don't lose it\n    in case you lose or change your server.\n  - Do not ever commit your config.txt, as it contains your Personal Access\n    Token.\n5. Add a webhook notification in your main project's `.travis.yml` file:\n  - ```\n    notifications:\n      webhooks: http://<your-server-here>/prbuildbot/travis\n    ```\n  - Your server can be referenced by either an IP address or a fully-qualified\n    domain name.\n6. Once your updated `.travis.yml` file is in your project, you should start\n   receiving comments on pull requests from this bot.\n   - Example: https://github.com/bobholt/web-platform-tests/pull/4\n\n### Configuration Properties\n\n| Property        | Description                                                                                                                                         |\n|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| TRAVIS_DOMAIN      | The Travis CI domain that applies to your application (either `travis-ci.com` or `travis-ci.org`)                                                                   |\n| COMMENT_ENV_VAR | An environment variable used in your Travis CI build matrix that serves as a flag for whether or not the job's log should be parsed as a PR comment |\n| GH_TOKEN        | The Personal Access Token created in Configuration Step 2, above                                                                                    |\n| ORG             | The GitHub organization/owner of the main repository (this project's ORG would be \"bobholt\")                                                        |\n| REPO            | The main repository (this project's REPO would be \"prbuildbot\")                                                                                     |\n\n## Testing\n\nIn the application root run `python test`.

It allows the standards development organization to maintain vendor neutral control over a specification, and thus protect the consensus found within a Working Group.\n\nIn the course of the development of materials within the W3C, Task Force Participants will make contributions. Those contributions will be integrated into the jointly developed work thus creating shared copyright on the Task Force Participant's contribution. Most W3C Specifications contain a section with acknowledgement of contributions.\n\nTask Force Participants grant to the W3C a perpetual, nonexclusive, royalty-free, world-wide right and license under any Task Force Participant's copyrights on his or her contributions, to copy, publish and distribute the contribution under a license of W3C's choosing. Additionally, the Task Force Participant grants a right and license of the same scope to any derivative works prepared by the W3C and based on, or incorporating all or part of, his or her contribution and that any derivative works of this contribution prepared by the W3C shall be solely owned by the W3C. Furthermore, the Task Force Participant understands that W3C will be able to exercise all rights as a copyright owner of Task Force Participant's contribution, including enforcement against infringers without additional agreement or notice.\n\nNothing in this agreement restricts the Task Force Participant from using their individual contributions as they wish, even if those have later been amalgamated into joint works. Where W3C releases materials under a permissive license such as the W3C Software License or CC-BY, nothing in this agreement should be read to restrict the Task Force Participant from exercising the permissions granted by that license. The Task Force Participant represents that they are legally entitled to grant the above license. If their employer(s) have rights to intellectual property that the Task Force Participant creates that includes the contributions, they represent that they have received permission to make contributions on behalf of that employer or that the employer has waived such rights for the contributions to W3C.\n\n\n## Decency\n\nThe Task Force Participant will participate in the W3C Group in a decent way. Task Force Participants will refrain from defaming, harassing or otherwise offending other participants. The [Section 3.1 of the Process Document](https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#ParticipationCriteria) applies, as does the W3C [Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/).\n\nThe Task Force Participant will refrain from sending unsolicited commercial messages to W3C mailing-lists and other promotional activities for personal matters or for third parties. This is especially required from Task Force Participants sending messages to public W3C Groups.\n",

That list is notified once a day (in digest form) about not only changes to this repository, but also about other W3C Working Group issues related to the Hebrew writing systems. (Please use github issues rather than the mailing list to send feedback.)  Meeting minutes are also sent to public-i18n-hebrew.\n\nYou can find a list of open issues, including those from W3C Working Groups, on the [Layout Tracker](http://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/textlayout/?filter=hebrew) page.

All email comments will be available in a\n[public archive](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webapps).\n\nIf you are not a participant in the [W3C Web Platform Working Group](https://w3.org/WebPlatformWG) \nyour contributions may be marked as having \"IPR issues\". If the contributions are purely editorial,\nthis will be handled by the editors, but if they involve changes to conformance, such as new features,\nthey will not be accepted without a formal agreement to W3C's intellectual property policies (see below for more) \n\n### Issues\nIssues should describe the problem. Proposals to fix it can be made as comments on the issue,\nbut should include known implementation of the proposal.\n\nIf you want to make a Pull request for simple editorial corrections, it is not necessary to raise an issue.\n\n### Pull requests\nThe best way to propose a fix is to make a branch,\ncommit your changes to the branch and then create a Pull Request. Pull Requests should inclue the following information:\n\n; Does it fix a known issue? \n: If so, add `Fix #333, #222` in a line by itself in a comment, which will close the issue\n; Does it relate to a known issue? \n: If so, add a comment like `see also #444, #111`, and preferably an explanation of how it relates.\n: If not, and it is more than merely editorial, please open an issue\n; Known implementation of the change\n; Links to tests for any changed behaviour\n: Ideally these will be in the form of Web-platform-tests but there are things that can require a manual test.\n; Acknowledgements and changelog updates\n: If the issue has been worked on by somebody who is not acknowledged already in the acknolwedgements section,\n please add their name\n: If the change is substantive, i.e. affects conformance, or a significant editorial one, please note it in the changes section\n\n## Licensing and IPR\n\nContributions to this repository are expected to become part of a Recommendation governed by the\n[W3C Patent Policy](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy-20040205/) and\n[W3C Software and Document License](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/copyright-software).

      "readme": "# Specification 'Web of Things (WoT) Thing Description'\n\nEach commit here will sync it to the master, which will expose the content to http://w3c.github.io/wot-thing-description/.\n\nTo make contributions, please provide pull-requests to the appropriate files,\nkeeping in mind that some files, most notably `index.html` and `testing/report.html', \nas well as most files under `visualization`, are\nautogenerated and should not be modified directly.\nSee [github help](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) for \ninformation on how to create a pull request.\n\n## Rendering\n\nPart of the document is automatically rendered using the [STTL.js](https://github.com/vcharpenay/STTL.js/) RDF template engine and Node.js.\n_Any change to the document must be performed on the main HTML template [`index.template.html`](index.template.html)_, and not on `index.html`.\nTo render `index.html`, along with SVG figures, run: \n\n```sh\nnpm run render\n```\n\nYou can also invoke the rendering script directly:\n```sh\n./render.sh\n```\n\nRequirements: Java 8, Node.js 6, [GraphViz](graphviz.org/).\n\nThe script will first download and install some dependencies (triple store, Node.js dependencies) and then execute the JS script `render.js`.\nThe latter should always be execute within `render.sh` since it requires some env variables to be set first.\n\nFor Windows users, the script should be run in a [Cygwin shell](http://cygwin.com/). Git package from Cygwin distribution had better not be used. Alternative Git client distribution such as [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) works better when you encounter an issue building the document using Cygwin.\n\nRendering is primarly based on the content of [`validation/td-validation.ttl`](validation/td-validation.ttl).\nAny customization of the rendering should go there. e.g. by defining `sh:order` or `sh:description` triples for the relevant shapes.\n\n## Implementation Report\n\nTo generate the implementation report,\nincluding a list of normative assertions,\nissue the following command:\n```sh\nnpm run assertions\n```\nA draft implementation report will be generated and output to\n[testing/report.html](testing/report.html)\nwhich will use relative links back up to [index.html](index.html).\nThe input to this process is [index.html](index.html)\n(_not_ `index.html.template`) so make sure to execute `npm run render` first.\n\nFor this to work, the assertions need to \nbe marked up as in the following examples and follow RFC2119 conventions:\n```html\n<span class=\"rfc2119-assertion\" id=\"additional-vocabularies\">\n  A JSON TD MAY contain additional optional vocabularies that are \n  not in the Thing Description core model.\n</span>\n<span class=\"rfc2119-assertion\" id=\"additional-vocabularies-prefix\">\n  Terms from additional optional vocabularies used in a JSON-TD MUST \n  carry a prefix for identification within the key name\n  (e.g., <tt>\"http:header\"</tt>).\n</span>\n```\n\nThe assertions must be marked up as follows:\n* Enclose each assertion in a span.\n* Mark the span with unique id.\n  It is recommended that the section id be followed\n  by a short unique name for the specific assertion.\n* Mark the span with a 'class' attribute set to `rfc2119-assertion`.\n* Include one (and only one) instance of the RFC2119 keywords (MUST, MAY, etc.)\n  in capitals.\nThis markup does not change the rendering; it just clearly indicates\nand uniquely names the assertion.\n\nIt is strongly recommended to make assertions independent of context.\nIn particular, avoid using pronouns or relational expressions\nreferring to previous statements not included in the assertion.\nSuch references can always be replaced with their\nantecendent (\"dereferenced\") without changing the meaning,\nand this is less ambigious anyway.\nFor example, instead of using \"this serialization\", use\n\"a JSON-TD serialization\".\n\nAlso, assertions should ideally only constrain one item.\nMultiple constraints should be stated in separate sentences.\n\nNote that the above rendering process also assigns each\ntable entry a unique ID and these are also listed in the \ntable included in the implementation report.\n\nOther data, e.g. data from test results, test specifications,\nand implementation descriptions, are also needed to complete the \nimplementation report.  See [testing/README.md](testing/README.md)\nfor details.\n\nThe generation of the implementation report also generates a CSS file\n`testing/atrisk.css`\nthat highlights at-risk items in the generated `index.html`.  The at-risk\nitems are listed in `testing/inputs/atrisk.csv`.  If at-risk items are\nupdated, to update the at-risk highlighting the implementation report\nneeds to be generated first, and then the rendering.\n",

See the rendered version here: [http://w3c.github.io/wot-scripting-api/](http://w3c.github.io/wot-scripting-api/).\n\nCopies of the releases for [published versions](https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-scripting-api/) are found in [releases](./releases/).\nThe latest published version currently is the [First Public Working Draft](https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/WD-wot-scripting-api-20170914/).\n\nSee the [rationale.md](./rationale.md) for explanation on API design choices.\n\nSee the [primer.md](./primer/README.md) for explaining and illustrating the usage of the API.\n\nSee the [applications/script-manager](./applications/script-manager/README.md) on the design of a Thing for script management.\n\nSee the [applications/thing-directory](./applications/thing-directory/README.md) on the design of a Thing directory (reverse proxy) that would cache nearby Things, provide a single point of access and synchronize with the cached Things.\n\nTo make contributions, please refer to [https://github.com/w3c/wotwg#contributing](https://github.com/w3c/wotwg#contributing).\n\n## TypeScript Definitions\n\nThe specification uses WebIDL definitions. TypeScript definititions are also available (see https://github.com/thingweb/wot-typescript-definitions/blob/master/index.d.ts).\n\nDue to different implementation progress the definitions might be out of sync. However, there are regular sync points usually based on publication releases.\nNote: For future releases we plan to use TypeScript instead of WebIDL in the specification.\n",

      "readme": "# type-samples\nA place to find and contribute examples of typographic features in text, especially from non-Latin scripts.\n\n**Please do not use the issues in this repo to discuss typographic features.** Each issue should just be a referenceable storage location fo one image. Any comments below that image and its metadata should only refer to the image itself (eg. suitability, clarification, etc), and not lead to a general discussion about the feature illustrated. Those discussions should be moved elsewhere.\n\n## How to find a sample\nUse the **[Visual Index](https://w3c.github.io/type-samples/)** (Currently still a prototype.)\n\nClick on a radio button in the right column to select what type of image you are interested in. Refine it by script/medium, if you want. Click on a thumbnail to see the image with metadata.\n\nWhen looking at an issue, you can click on the image to see a larger version.\n\n## How to submit an image\n\n_Warning: The current setup is experimental, and may change if a more effective method is found._\n\nIf you want to submit an image to the repo please raise an issue and follow these instructions. \n\nBy submitting an image you indicate that you agree to be bound by the stipulations in [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/w3c/type-samples/blob/gh-pages/CONTRIBUTING.md). The repo is moderated.  If an image submission is accepted, the moderator will add the labels that make the issue visible in the index, but may edit the title and body text you provided before doing so.\n\n### The issue title\n\nShould have the following structure:\n```\n<script-tag> <lang-tag> <media-label> <one or more space-separated feature-labels>\n```\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nhebr he newsprint justification text-decoration\n```\n\nThe script and lang tags should be those in BCP-47. [Find a tag](http://r12a.github.io/apps/subtags/).\n\nThe `<media-label>` should be one of the following (the list is likely to grow over time). There should only be ONE feature label in the issue title.\n`book, inscription, magazine, mockup, newsprint, printedmatter, signage, software, webpage, other`\n\nThere should be only ONE `feature-label` per line in the issue body, but ALL feature labels used in the body should appear at the end of the title (space separated).  Feature labels should be one of the following.\n`abbreviation bidi-text emphasis font-style fonts glyphs-diacritics hyphenation initial-letter inline-spacing justification lists notes-footnotes numbers punctuation quotations ruby text-decoration vertical-text`\n\nIf you need something different, leave a note in the body of the issue.\n\n### The issue body\n\nShould start with an image. **There should only be one image per issue.** You should drag and drop the image into the issue, rather than point to it with a link.\n\nAfter the image, use the following syntax:\n\n```\n---\ntag: <feature-label> <short description>\n[possibly more lines like that just above]\nsource: <description of the source of the image, and a link for online resources>\n---\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\n---\ntag: font-style Oblique-styled text leaning to the left.\ntag: abbreviation Heh with joining form and extended baseline in date.\nsource: Asharq al Awsat, p1, 12 Dec 1994\n---\n```\n\nDescriptions should be short and succinct, like titles. They should indicate what the image illustrates.\n\nYou can add descriptive text below, if really needed.  It's also helpful to provide a text transcription of the content in the image for those who want to create tests, so that they can copy and paste the text.\n\nYou won't be able to add github labels. They will be applied for you.

Open Athletics includes schemes and vocabularies to describe sports, as well as open source software that helps managing that kind of information.\n\nThrough OpenTrack and Open Athletics, entities around the world (sport clubs, federations, private event organizers, etc.) will be able to open the data contributing towards open data in sports. This will bring new business opportunities to third parties (developers, public bodies, private companies, citizens, academia).\n\nIn order to maximize the impact and adoption of the final proposal, this initiative is supported by [European Athletics](http://www.european-athletics.org) and other [relevant institutions](https://www.w3.org/community/opentrack/participants) of the world of *Data Management* and *Athletics*.\n\nRead the [Charter](https://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/charter.html) for more information about this group.\n\n## What tools?\n\nThe main component of OpenTrack is a set of vocabularies and taxonomies that will help publishers to model and expose information regarding athletics (events, athletes, facilities, results, rankings, and others).\n\nParticipants in this group will contribute with code recipes, libraries, and examples about the use of athletics information.\n\nCurrently, we are working on what we call it, **Open Athletics** models, vocabularies, and tools: \n\n* A **[Conceptual Data Model for Athletics](https://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/spec/model/)** to define Athletics competitions, events, management and participation in an abstract way; and\n* a **[Sports Competition Data Model and Vocabulary](https://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/spec/competition/)** based on Schema.org. It contains examples of implementation for competitions, participation, athletes, organizations, etc.\n* some **[code examples](http://purl.org/athletics/codes)** to illustrate how to use the former vocabulary to describe entities (i.e., athletes, clubs, and federations), and competitions (i.e., disciplines, categories, events) and some useful codes and taxonomies for countries, in-competition features, etc.\n\n## Formats and standards\n\nAll documents will be written in English and encoded in UTF-8.\n\nSchemas and vocabularies will be aligned with the existing W3C standards, in concrete with the Data on the Web specifications. Although they will be described as abstract vocabularies, they will be also modeled in RDF.\n\n\n## Can I use it?\n\nOf course you can!

Just click on the 'join' button, and register with your W3C account (in case you don't have, please [request one](https://www.w3.org/accounts/request).

Most of the features of [David Booth's script](https://dev.w3.org/2002/scribe/scribedoc.htm) are retained. See also a separate [feature summary](features.md) for an easier reference. The IRC log can either be provided as an input to the script on the command line, or can be fetched directly from the W3C site. The generated minutes are either stored locally or are committed to a GitHub repository directly.\n\nThe reason of writing this script is that the current approach of producing HTML minutes on the W3C date space has become difficult to handle these days when Working Groups typically work on GitHub and WG members do not have CVS access to W3C. This means that the current process relies heavily on the staff contact on the slightest possible change of the minutes. In a GitHub working environment the “obvious” approach is to produce the minutes in markdown and push that onto the group’s repository; if so, the minutes can be read and, if necessary, updated, changed, improved, etc, by other Group members.\n\n## Usage\n\n### Browser\n\nThe `BrowserView/` directory contains an HTML file which provides a basic UI for loading and editing IRC logs and processing them into Markdown (see the [service on-line](https://w3c.github.io/scribejs/BrowserView/index.html)). See the [Installation](#installation) section below for more information.\n\n### Command Line\n\nThe script runs on top of `node.js`. The “entry point” is the `main.js` file, which accepts the following command line arguments:\n\n```\nscribejs [options] [filename]\n[--date|-d] date:    Date of the meeting in ISO (i.e., YYYY-MM-DD) format.\n                     Default: today.\n[--group|-g] group:  Name of the IRC channel used by the group.\n[--config|-c] cfile: JSON configuration file (see [below](#conf)). Command\n                     line arguments have a higher priority.\n[--nick|-n] nfile:   JSON nickname mapping URL or filename (see [below](#nick)).\n[--output|-o] ofile: Output file name. See [below](#output) on how the final output is chosen.\n[--final|-f]:        The minutes are final, i.e., they won't be labeled as \"DRAFT\".\n[--repo|-r]:         Whether the output should be stored in a github repository.\n                     Default: false.\n[--pandoc|-p]:       Whether the output is meant to be converted further by pandoc.\n                     Default: false.\n[--jekyll|-j]:       Whether the output should be adapted to a Github+Jekyll combination.\n                     Value can be \"none\", \"md\", or \"kd\" (see [below](#jekyll) for further details.)\n                     Default: \"md\".\n[--irc|-i] client:   Whether the input is of the log format of a particular IRC client.\n                     Value can be \"textual\", for the Textual IRC client; other values are (currently) ignored.\n                     Default: undefined, meaning that the log provided by W3C's RRSAgent is used.\n```\n\n### Configuration files\n\nWhile some of the values can be set on a command line, most of the configuration values are set in a JSON configuration file. The file name can be provided on the command line (see above). Otherwise, a user-level configuration file `~/.scribejs.json` will be used, if present.\n\nThe keys are as follows (see also the [description of the command line](#usage) for their explanation). Use only those keys that have a meaningful value.\n\n* `date`         : Date in ISO Format\n* `group`        : Group's IRC name\n* `input`        : Input\n* `output`       : Output file name; irrelevant if `torepo` is `true`\n* `nicknames`    : Nickname file reference in the form of a URL or a filename\n* `final`        : `true`|`false`\n* `torepo`       : `true`|`false`\n* `pandoc`       : `true`|`false`\n* `jekyll`       : `\"none\"`|`\"md\"`|`\"kd\"`\n* `irc_format`   : `\"textual\"`|`undefined`\n* `ghrepo`       : repository name, eg, `w3c/scribejs`\n* `ghpath`       : path in the repository to the folder where the minutes are to be stored\n* `ghbranch`     : branch of the repository where the minutes should be stored. If not set, default is used\n* `acrepo`       : repository name where action issues should be generated. If not set, the value of `ghrepo` is used if set.\n* `acurlpattern` : url pattern used to refer the minutes. The strings `%YEAR%`, `%MONTH%`, `%DAY%`, and `%DATE%` are replaced by the respective values. Used to put references into the minutes when generating issues for actions.\n* `ghname`       : github login name\n* `ghemail`      : github email\n* `ghtoken`      : OAUTH personal access token (see the [relevant GitHub site](https://github.com/settings/tokens) for further details on OAUTH tokens and to generate one)\n\nThe final configuration is a combination of the command line arguments, the (optional) configuration file provided through the command line, and the user-level configuration file (if it exists), in decreasing priority.\n\nA typical usage of the configuration files is:\n\n* set the group‘s repository data (e.g., `ghrepo`, `ghpath`, `ghbranch`, `acrepo`, `acurlpattern`, `group`, `nicknames`) in a shared configuration file that can be part of the repository itself;\n* use the user-level configuration for the more personal entries like `ghname`, `ghemail`, and `ghtoken`. **This is especially important for `ghtoken` which should *never* be part of any repository in clear text** (in fact, GitHub catches those occurrences in a repository and invalidates those tokens immediately…)\n* use the command line for the right date (which is used by the script to retrieve the IRC log) and for the switch whether the output should be a local file (possibly modified locally and committed to the GitHub repository manually) or whether it should be committed automatically. Note that, obviously, the `gh*` type keys can be ignored if the user choses to never commit minutes automatically on GitHub.\n\nThere is a [JSON schema](schemas/config_schema.json) to validate the configuration file. The validation is also done run-time; the script warns (on `stderr`) if the configuration file is invalid, and a minimal default configuration is used instead.\n\n### Choice of the output\n\nThe script’s choice of where resulting file is stored is as follows:\n\n* if the value of `torepo` in the final configuration is `true`, the `gh...` values are used to determine the github repository (with, optionally, the relevant branch) and the path within the repository where the minutes should be stores (or updated);\n* otherwise, if the `output` value is set, the result is stored in that file;\n* otherwise the result is sent to the standard output.\n\nThis means that the simplest possible usage of the script boils down to:\n\n```bash\nscribejs IRC-log-file\n```\n\nwhich takes the log from the local `IRC-log-file` and sends the markdown minutes to standard output.\n\n### Nickname mapping\n\nThis JSON file is used to provide mapping among IRC nicknames and real names. The file itself is an array of objects; each object can use the following keys (use only those with a meaningful value):\n\n* `nick` : the value is an _array_ of strings, each representing a possible IRC handle (nickname); this array (even if empty) is _required_.\n* `name` : the value is a string, providing the name to be displayed for that person; this string is _required_.\n* `github` : the GitHub id of the person\n* `url` : a URL that can be used to set the person’s name as an active link (currently not used, but may be used later).\n\n\nThere is a [JSON schema](schemas/nicknames_schema.json) to validate the nickname mapping file. The validation is also done run-time; the script warns (on `stderr`) if the nickname mapping file is invalid, and an empty mapping is used instead.\n\n### Pandoc\n\nThe generated minutes may be converted into some other format using [pandoc](https://pandoc.org). If so, a special [title header]((https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#metadata-blocks)) is added, to be used by pandoc when generating HTML or LaTeX.\n\n### Jekyll option\n\nThe generated minutes may be part of a page hosted by GitHub via the [Github+Jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/about-github-pages-and-jekyll/) combination. The possible options, and their meaning, are as follows.\n\n* `none`: Jekyll is ignored. This is the default.\n* `md`: the generated minutes includes a special heading, namely:\n    ```\n    ---\n    layout: minutes\n    date: [date of minutes]\n    ---\n    ```\n\n    Furthermore, the W3C logo is _not_ added to the minutes; this can be done by the layout used for the minutes. The syntax is (Github) markdown.\n* `kd`: beyond the features of the `md` option, the minutes are generated in [kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/documentation.html) syntax and not in (standard Github) markdown. This is the markdown dialect used by Jekyll; the notable difference, in terms of the generated minutes, is the syntax used to assign an identifier to a header, resolution, or an action. As a bonus, the resolutions and the actions are assigned a class name (`resolution` and `action`, respectively) which can be used for extra styling.\n\n#### Generated class names\n\nIf the generated minutes are in kramdown format then a number of sections/paragraphs/etc. get specific class names. These can be used for CSS styling when the minutes are generated by Jekyll in HTML. These are:\n\n| Section content                        | class name |\n|----------------------------------------| ---------- |\n| resolution                             | `resolution` |\n| proposed resolution                    | `proposed_resolution` |\n| summary                                | `summary` |\n| action                                 | `action` |\n| Draft notice at the top of the minutes | `draft_notice` |\n\n## Installation\n\nSetup the project locally and install Node.js dependencies:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/w3c/scribejs.git\ncd scribejs\nnpm install\n```\n\nFollow specific instructions based on your needs/interests below.\n\n### Browser\n\n```bash\nnpm run build\nnpm run serve\n```\n\nYou should be able to load the UX via `http://localhost:8080` (or whichever port was chosen by `http-server`).\n\n### Command Line\n\nStandard Node.js practices have been followed.\n\n```bash\ncp config.json.sample ~/.scribejs.json\n$EDITOR ~/.scribejs.json                  # Fill in details: your GH token, etc\n```\n\nTo run scribejs (in its own directory):\n\n```bash\nnode .\n```\n\nOptionally, you can install it globally with:\n\n```bash\nsudo npm i -g .\n```\n\nwhich will create a symbolic link to `main.js` in the user's search path with the name `scribejs`, so you should be able to invoke it this way, too:\n\n```bash\nscribejs\n```\n\nThe `schemas` directory also includes two [JSON schemas](http://json-schema.org/documentation.html) files for the configuration and the nickname json files, respectively. These can be used with a suitable schema processor (e.g., the [CLI for ajv](https://github.com/jessedc/ajv-cli)) to check the validity of the configuration files. This schemas are used by the running code, too, to check configuration and nickname files.\n\n## Testing\n\n```bash\nnpm test\n```\n\nIf you have [Growl](https://github.com/tj/node-growl#installation) setup for\nyour platform, you can use it like so:\n\n```bash\nnpm test -- --growl\n```\n\n## Linting\n\nWe like clean code, so we've introduced tools to help our shared consistency.\nYou can use `eslint` in the context of this project by running:\n\n```sh\nnpm run lint -- main.js\n```\n\nIt will be run using the configuration settings found in `.eslintrc.yml`.\n\n---\n\nMaintainers: [Ivan Herman](https://github.com/iherman) and [BigBlueHat](http://bigbluehat.com/)\n",

Events are fired during a flush.\n- When Doctrine events are fired, you are not assured that the entities have actually been saved in the database. \nThis is obvious for preUpdate (sent before persisting the changes), but postPersist and preRemove have the same issue: \nif you persist two new entities in a single transaction, the first insert could work (thus an event would be sent) but \nnot the second, resulting in no entities being saved at all\n\nThis bundle aims at circumventing these issues by providing means to fire entity creation, deletion and update events \nafter a successful flush or whenever needed.\n\nIt also provides a set of annotation to configure what events should be sent and when.\n\nThis bundle was partially inspired by @kriswallsmith's talk\n[\"Matters of State\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEiwP4w6mf4).\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nSimply run assuming you have installed composer.phar or composer binary:\n\n``` bash\n$ php composer.phar require w3c/lifecycle-events-bundle 1.0.*\n```\n\nFinally, enable the bundle in the kernel:\n\n``` php\n<?php\n// app/AppKernel.php\n\npublic function registerBundles()\n{\n    $bundles = array(\n        // ...\n        new W3C\\LifecycleEventsBundle\\W3CLifecycleEventsBundle(),\n    );\n}\n```\nThat's it!\n\nUsage\n-----\n\n### Annotations\n\nFor this bundle to do anything interesting, it is necessary to annotate entities you want to monitor.\nThere are five annotations. Three of them apply to classes (`@Create`, `@Delete` and `@Update`) and the remaining two to\nproperties (`@Change`, `@IgnoreClassUpdates`).\n\nAll annotations live in the namespace `W3C\\LifecycleEventsBundle\\Annotation`, so it is recommended to import it:\n``` php\n<?php\nuse W3C\\LifecycleEventsBundle\\Annotation as On;\n```\n\n#### `@On\\Create` \n\nMonitors the creation of new entities. It accepts the following parameters:\n- `event`: the event being sent every time an entity is created (`w3c.lifecycle.created` by default)\n- `class`: the class of this event (`W3C\\LifecycleEventsBundle\\Event\\LifecycleEvent` by default). This class\nmust have a constructor with the following signature:\n\n``` php\n<?php\n/**\n * @param mixed $entity the entity being created\n */\npublic function __construct($entity)\n```\n\n#### `@On\\Delete`\n\nMonitors the deletion (or soft deletion, if you use Doctrine Extensions) of entities. It accepts the following parameters:\n- `event`: the event being sent every time an entity is deleted (`w3c.lifecycle.deleted` by default)\n- `class`: the class of this event (`W3C\\LifecycleEventsBundle\\Event\\LifecycleEvent` by default). This class\nmust have a constructor with the following signature:\n\n``` php\n<?php\n/**\n * @param mixed $entity the entity being deleted\n * @param array $identifier identifier of the entity being deleted\n */\npublic function __construct($entity, $identifier)\n```\n\n#### `@On\\Update`\n\nMonitors updates to entities. It accepts the following parameters:\n- `event`: the event being sent (`w3c.lifecycle.updated` by default) every time an entity is updated\n- `class`: the class of this event (`W3C\\LifecycleEventsBundle\\Event\\LifecycleUpdateEvent` by default). This class\nmust have a constructor with the following signature: \n\n``` php\n<?php\n/**\n * @param object $entity the entity being modified\n * @param array $propertiesChangeSet list of changes to properties\n * @param array $collectionsChangeSet list of changes to collections\n */\npublic function __construct($entity, array $propertiesChangeSet = null, array $collectionsChangeSet = null)\n```\n- `monitor_collections`: whether the annotation should monitor changes to collection fields. Defaults to true\n- `monitor_owning`: whether owning side relationship changes should be also monitored as inverse side changes. Defaults to false\n\n#### `@On\\Change`\n\nMonitors whenever an entity field (property or collection) changes. It accepts the following parameters:\n- `event`: the event being sent (`w3c.lifecycle.property_changed` or `w3c.lifecycle.collection_changed` by default) \nevery time an entity is updated\n- `class`: the class of this event (`W3C\\LifecycleEventsBundle\\Event\\LifecyclePropertyChangedEvent` by default if put on\na regular property, `W3C\\LifecycleEventsBundle\\Event\\LifecycleCollectionChangedEvent` when put on a collection).\nThis class must have a constructor with the following signature for regular properties: \n\n``` php\n<?php\n/**\n * @param object $entity entity being modified\n * @param string $property property being modified\n * @param array $oldValue property's old value\n * @param array $newValue property's new value\n */\npublic function __construct($entity, $property, $oldValue = null, $newValue = null)\n```\nand for collections:\n\n``` php\n<?php\n/**\n * @param object $entity entity being modified\n * @param string $property collection being modified\n * @param array $deletedElements elements being deleted from the collection\n * @param array $insertedElements elements being inserted to the collection\n */\npublic function __construct($entity, $property, $deletedElements = null, $insertedElements = null)\n```\n- `monitor_owning`: whether to record changes to this field when owning sides change (defaults to `false`). Using\n`@On\\Change` on inverse side of relationships won't trigger any events unless this paramter is set to true. This\nparameter is likely to be removed in the next major version and act as if it was set to `true` since when the \nannotation is added to the inverse side of relationship, it is obvious it means that you want changes to owning side to\nbe monitored here\n\n#### `@On\\IgnoreClassUpdates`\n\nThis annotation is a bit different. When placed on a field (property or collection), it prevents `@On\\Update` from \nfiring events related to this field. `@On\\Change` ones will still work. This annotation does not allow any parameters.\n\n#### Example class\n\n``` php\n<?php\n/**\n * Person\n *\n * @ORM\\Table(name=\"person\")\n * @ORM\\Entity(repositoryClass=\"AppBundle\\Repository\\PersonRepository\")\n * @On\\Create(\n *     PersonEvents::CREATED,\n *     class=PersonEvent::class\n * )\n * @On\\Delete(\n *     PersonEvents::DELETED,\n *     class=PersonEvent::class\n * )\n * @On\\Update(PersonEvents::UPDATED)\n */\nclass Person\n{\n    /**\n     * @var int\n     *\n     * @ORM\\Column(name=\"id\", type=\"integer\")\n     * @ORM\\Id\n     * @ORM\\GeneratedValue(strategy=\"AUTO\")\n     */\n    private $id;\n\n    /**\n     * @var string\n     *\n     * @ORM\\Column(name=\"name\", type=\"string\", length=255, unique=true)\n     * @On\\Change(PersonEvents::PROPERTY_CHANGED)\n     */\n    private $name;\n\n    /**\n     * @var Person[]|Collection\n     *\n     * @ORM\\ManyToMany(targetEntity=\"Person\")\n     * @ORM\\JoinTable(name=\"friendships\",\n     *      joinColumns={@ORM\\JoinColumn(name=\"person_id\", referencedColumnName=\"id\")},\n     *      inverseJoinColumns={@ORM\\JoinColumn(name=\"friend_id\", referencedColumnName=\"id\")}\n     *      )\n     * @On\\Change()\n     * @On\\IgnoreClassUpdates()\n     */\n    private $friends;\n\n    [...]   \n}\n```\n\nWith such a class, the following events will be fired:\n- `PersonEvents::CREATED` when a Person is created, with the class `PersonEvent`\n- `PersonEvents::DELETED` when a Person is deleted, with the class `PersonEvent`\n- `PersonEvents::UPDATED` when a Person is updated, with the  class `LifecycleUpdatedEvent`, but will not record changes\nto `Person::$friends`\n- `PersonEvents::PROPERTY_CHANGED` when Person::$name changes, with the class `LifecyclePropertyChangedEvent`\n- `w3c.lifecycle.collection_changed` when Person::$friends changes, with the class `LifecycleCollectionChangedEvent`\n\nDisabling automatic dispatching of events\n-----------------------------------------\n\nLifecycle events are dispatched by default after a successful flush. If needed, this can be disabled:\n- globally in config.yml\n``` yaml\nw3_c_lifecycle_events:\n    auto_dispatch:        false\n```\n- temporarily in a container (before Symfony 4):\n\n``` php\n<?php\n$dispatcher = $this->container->get(\"w3c_lifecycle_events.dispatcher\");\n$dispatcher->setAutoDispatch(false);\n```\n\n- temporarily in a container (since Symfony 4):\n\n``` php\n<?php\nuse W3C\\LifecycleEventsBundle\\Services\\LifecycleEventsDispatcher;\npublic function testAction(LifecycleEventsDispatcher $dispatcher)\n{\n    [...]\n    $dispatcher->setAutoDispatch(false);\n    [...]\n}\n```\n\nEvents can then be dispatched manually using the following:\n``` php\n<?php\n$dispatcher->dispatchEvents(); // manually dispatch all events\n```\n\nSpecial case: inheritance\n-------------------------\n\nIf you use inheritance in your entities, make sure to set fields of the parent class(es) protected (or public) so that\nchanges to those can be monitored as belonging to subclasses.\n\nFailing to do so may lead to `\\ReflectionException` exceptions such as:\n```\nProperty W3CGroup::$updated does not exist. Could this be a private field of a parent class?\n```\nEven if those fields are not monitored!\n",

      "readme": "# MNX\n\nWelcome to the [Music Notation Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/music-notation/)'s next-generation music markup proposal.\n\nQuick links:\n\n- Read the [current MNX draft specification](https://w3c.github.io/mnx/specification/).\n- Peruse the [MNX-Common examples](https://github.com/w3c/mnx/tree/master/examples).\n- Look at the [MNX-Generic examples](https://joeberkovitz.github.io/gmnx-viewer/).\n\n## An introduction to MNX-Common\n\nMNX-Common is a new, open standard for representing music notation as machine-readable data. It’s still being created, but this document gives context on our goals and plans.\n\nConceptually, MNX-Common is a way to represent this image:\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/w3c/mnx/blob/master/middle-c.png\" alt=\"Image of music notation with middle C\" width=\"300\">\n\n...as something like this:\n\n```\nstaves=1\nkeysignature=C major\nclef=treble\nnotes=whole note at C4\n```\n\nThe former, an image, is intended for humans. A computer can’t understand it without using advanced, error-prone [computer vision techniques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_music_recognition).\n\nThe latter — which encodes the _meaning_ (aka _semantics_) of the music, as opposed to a specific collection of pixels — is much easier for a computer to understand. Treating music in this way means it can be shared among different programs, automatically manipulated and much more.\n\nMNX-Common is a standard that describes how to encode music, so that computers can have a shared understanding on how to interpret it. As HTML describes a web page such that any web browser can read it, MNX-Common describes a piece of music such that any notation software can read or write it.\n\n### Motivation\n\nPeople have been using computers to encode music for decades; a wide variety of encoding formats has been developed over the years. Why do we need yet another format?\n\nEach music encoding format has its own biases and priorities. The [ABC format](https://abcnotation.com/), for example, aims for simplicity and was originally developed for folk music. [MusicXML](https://www.musicxml.com/) is optimized for notation interchange. [MIDI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI) focuses on low-level instrument sequencing, as opposed to higher-level musical concepts. [MEI](https://music-encoding.org/), a general-purpose framework for encoding arbitrary musical documents, pays particular attention to the needs of scholars. Proprietary formats, such as [Finale](https://www.finalemusic.com/)’s `.musx` or [Sibelius](https://www.avid.com/sibelius)’ `.sib`, are optimized for specific notation programs and not meant to be read by others.\n\nOur goal with MNX-Common is to create a format that does all of the following:\n\n* **It’s open**, meaning: it’s clearly documented, free to use and developed in a vendor-independent, inclusive way.\n* **It supports all of Common Western Musical Notation (CWMN)**, meaning: it has a clear answer for how to encode any musical concept found in CWMN. (CWMN is, by nature, an [imprecise concept](https://w3c.github.io/mnx/overview/#mnx-score-types).)\n* **It prioritizes interchange**, meaning: it can be generated unambiguously, it can be parsed unambiguously, it favors one-and-only-one way to express concepts, and multiple programs reading the same MNX-Common file will interpret it the same way.\n* **It’s semantically rich**, meaning: it’s biased toward encoding concepts rather than presentation when prudent.\n* **It can be used as a native format**, meaning: it’s robust enough for programs to use directly instead of needing to invent their own format.\n\nThe existing format that comes closest to these goals is MusicXML. In fact, MNX-Common’s creation is being led by the [W3C Music Notation Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/music-notation/), which also oversees the MusicXML standard. So what’s the difference?\n\nWe see MNX-Common as the next generation of MusicXML, enabling new uses that MusicXML didn’t set out to support.\n\nWith hundreds of applications supporting it, MusicXML has succeeded in becoming the de facto notation interchange standard. These days, you can be reasonably sure that, if you compose music in a commonly used notation application, you’ll be able to export it and open it in another application with decent fidelity — thanks to MusicXML. This has been a major cultural step forward, considering major notation programs hadn’t always looked kindly on making music exportable into competitors’ products.\n\nAs the dream of universal interchange has become a reality, users and developers have come to demand even more. Users want richer interchange (i.e., preserving the details of music more crisply), the advent of “reflowing” web-based renderers has shifted expectations around music engraving, and some developers even use MusicXML as a native format (something it wasn’t designed to do).\n\nMNX-Common is an effort to take everything we’ve learned from 15 years of MusicXML development — along with its diverse community of developers, musicians and publishers — and build a better future together.\n\nFinally, we should note there are many music notation systems throughout the world’s cultures, along with historical notation systems. MNX-Common deals specifically with Common Western Musical Notation, as it’s a high priority for the current MusicXML community and it’s where our collective expertise is the strongest — but our long-term plan is to support other systems. We’re also designing a format tentatively called MNX-Generic, which allows for mappings between graphics and audio, and we envision adding other formats to the MNX family.\n\n### The plan / current status\n\nThe first step in our design was assembling an exhaustive list of roles and use cases for music notation in general. We published this document, [MNX Use Cases](https://w3c.github.io/mnx/use-cases/), in 2017. Not every use case there is meant to be covered by MNX-Common, but this is a solid reference that helps us consider the spectrum of what people do with digital music notation. It also gives us a common language around “roles” such as Composer, Performer or Developer.\n\nBeyond that, we’ve jumped into writing [an early draft specification for MNX-Common](https://w3c.github.io/mnx/overview/). The [MNX GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/w3c/mnx/issues) collects open issues we need to work through in designing the format.\n\nOur plan of action is to start with large questions — such as whether notes are stored by their sounding pitch or written pitch — and progressively nail down the format.\n",

      "readme": "# Device Memory\n\n## Motivation & Use cases\nA “one-size-fits-all” web experience does not work in a world with widely varying device capabilities. Web apps that delight users on high end devices can be unusable on low end devices, particularly in emerging markets.\nTo support a diverse web ecosystem that is inclusive of users on low end devices, apps need to be able to tailor their content to the device constraints. This allows users to consume content suited to their device, and ensures they have a good experience and fewer frustrations.\n\nDevelopers are interested in the “device class” for the following known use-cases:\n1. Serve a “lite” version of the site or specific components, for low end devices. Egs:\n- Google’s \"search lite\" is a 10KB search results page used in EM. \n- Serve a \"lite\" version of video player in Facebook\n- Serve lightweight tile images in Google Maps\n2. Normalize Metrics: analytics need to be able to normalize their metrics against the device-class. \nFor instance, a 100ms long task is a more severe issue on a Pixel vs. on a low end device.\n\nDevice memory is an interesting signal in this context. Low memory devices devices (under 512MB, 512MB-1GB) are widely used in emerging markets. Chrome telemetry indicates a large number of OOM (out-of-memory) crashes on foreground tabs on these devices. In this case, serving a lite version not only improves the user experience, it is necessary for the site to be usable at all (as opposed to crashing due to memory constraints).\n\n## Proposal\nWe propose a new HTTP Client Hints header and a web exposed API to surface device capabilities for memory (RAM). The mechanism should be extensible to other device capabilities such as CPU i.e. number of cores, clock speed etc.\nA Client Hints header will enable the server to deliver appropriate content, eg. a “lite” version of the site.\nThe JS API will be a convenience for analytics reporting and may be used to make runtime decisions eg. using more storage vs. making additional requests, requesting appropriate resources from the server etc.\n\nASIDE: the JS API for CPU Cores is already available via hardwareConcurrency API\n\n### The Header\nProposed Client Hints Header for memory: `Device-Memory`\\\n`Device-Memory : <value>`\\\nwhere `<value>` is an approximation of the amount of RAM in GiB (floating point number).\\\nThe `<value>` is calculated by using the actual device memory in MiB then rounding it to the nearest number where only the most significant bit can be set and the rest are zeros (nearest power of two). Then dividing that number by 1024.0 to get the value in GiB.\n\nAn upper bound and a lower bound should be set on the list of values. While implementations may choose different values, the recommended upper bound is 8GiB and the recommended lower bound is 0.25GiB (or 256MiB).\nThe upper and lower bounds are not explicit, as they are subject to change over time.\n\nThe following table illustrates some examples:\n\n| Actual in MiB | Rounded in MiB | Reported in GiB |\n|---------------|----------------|-----------------|\n| 500           | 512            | 0.5             |\n| 512           | 512            | 0.5             |\n| 768           | 512            | 0.5             |\n| 1000          | 1024           | 1               |\n| 1793          | 2048           | 2               |\n\nA full list of possible values is as follows:\n0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8\n\n#### Why separate header and rounding?\nHTTP caching doesn't deal well with mixed value headers, therefore separate headers are recommended. Also, rounding down to power of two enables caching and mitigates fingerprinting.\n\n#### When is the header sent?\nClient Hints cannot be used to enable providing network performance data on the first request, however this is being actively addressed with [this proposal](https://github.com/httpwg/http-extensions/issues/306#issuecomment-283549512).\nThe header is sent after an explicit per-origin opt-in via Client Hints mechanism. The following new hint will be added: `Accept-CH: Device-Memory`\n\nFor background, [Client Hints](http://httpwg.org/http-extensions/client-hints.html) provides a set of HTTP request header fields, known as Client Hints, to deliver content that is optimized for the device. In that sense using Client Hints is a great fit for this proposal.\nClient Hints recently addressed a [significant limitation in spec](https://github.com/httpwg/http-extensions/issues/306#issuecomment-283549512): opt-in can now be persisted across browser restarts using `max-age` in header.\n\n#### Usage Guidance\nServers can advertise support for Client Hints using the Accept-CH header field or an equivalent HTML meta element with http-equiv attribute\n```\n  Accept-CH = Device-Memory\n```\n\nThe Memory request header field is a number for the client’s device memory i.e. approximate amount of ram in GiB.\neg. 512 MiB will be reported as:\n```\n  Device-Memory: 0.5\n```\n\nServers can use this header to customize content for low memory device eg. serve light version of the app or a component such as a video player.\n\nNOTE: This header will not be immediately available in all browser. Do not assume presence of the header, and provide a graceful fallback for browsers that don't support the header.\n\n### The web exposed API\nWe propose adding the following API to navigator: `navigator.deviceMemory`\nwhich returns number of GiB of ram (floating point number) rounded down to the nearest power of two (same as the header).\n\n## Why not surface Device Class directly?\nWhile exposing a composite “Device Class” would be useful for developers, it has a number of challenges: it’s hard to specify in a future-proof manner as it is constantly changing, it requires significant and ongoing work (constantly update algorithm OR classify known devices), it is difficult to reach agreement amongst vendors, and come up with something that works for all web sites etc.\nWhile this is something worth considering down the road, we think we can get most of the benefit by exposing a couple of specific signals device memory and device CPU cores. In particular device memory is a reasonable proxy for device class.\n\n## Security & Privacy\nThe client hint header and API will only be available on HTTPS secure connections.\n\nSee [Security section in Client Hints](http://httpwg.org/http-extensions/client-hints.html#security-considerations).\nRequiring per-origin opt-in with Accept-CH restricts when the header is advertised.\nTo reduce fingerprinting risk, reported value is rounded to single most significant bit, as opposed to reporting the exact value. In addition, an upper and lower bound is placed on the reported values.\n\nNOTE: Device identification is already possible and rampant today, based on UA string.

      "contributing": "# Contributing to the W3C Process Document\nThank-you for offering to contribute to the [W3C Process Document](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/). Here we provide some details on how you can contribute. \n\nChanges to the process document tend to fall into a few classes, and how the W3C handles these varies. Simple editorial changes may require little review, but more substantial changes will require a more substantial review and discussions by the W3C community. Please read the material below, and get involved as explained. \n\nIf you have any questions, please [raise an issue](/../../issues).\n\n## Simple Editorial Changes\nFor simple editorial changes, please feel free to raise a `pull request` or [raise an issue](/../../issues) on this repository. A simple editorial change can be things like spelling and grammar mistakes, broken links, and so on.\n\nSome changes may appear simple but may actually be more complicated than they appear. Don't worry - please continue to send your `pull request` or [raise an issue](/../../issues) and we can discuss. \n\n## The W3C Process Community Group\nThe W3C runs a [Process Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/w3process/), which is an open group created to manage discussions on developing the [W3C Process Document](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/). Some suggestions for changes to the [W3C Process Document](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/) will need to be made within the [Process Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/w3process/), please see information below as to whether you need to take your suggestions to the group or can just raise a `pull request` or `issue`.\n\n## Changes that Affect the Way the W3C Operates but Do Not Change the Policy\nFor changes that affect the way that the W3C operates but do not change policy please do the following:\n\n* [Raise an issue](/../../issues) on this repo\n* Make sure the [Process Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/w3process/) adds the issue to its agenda. This will allow you to explain why you think this is an improvement to the operation of the W3C (it's probably not helpful to provide a Pull Request until you have consensus on the approach).\n\nThe best way to ensure your issue gets added to the [Process Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/w3process/) agenda is to add yourself to the group, please visit [the group homepage](https://www.w3.org/community/w3process/) and select the button \"Join or Leave this Group\".\n\nAnother way to ensure the [Process Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/w3process/) addressed your issue is to check back on the [issues page](/../../issues) page and ask whether it has been addressed. It is more effective to join the group, but you have this option if you need it. \n\nThe [Process Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/w3process/) will discuss your issue, and decide whether the change can be made or whether the issue needs to be brought to the [Advisory Board](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#AB) or [Advisory Committee](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#AC) for discussion; see the next section for more information on this process.\n\nIf the [Process Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/w3process/) agrees the issue does not change the policy and agrees to make the changes detailed in your issue, you may either raise a `pull request` or wait for the Editor to make the required changes. Note: raising a `pull request` **will** be faster. See more details about `pull requests` below.\n\n## Changes that Affect the Way the W3C Operates and Change the Policy\nFor changes that represent a change of policy in the W3C, the idea will need to be brought to the [Advisory Board](https://www.w3.org/2002/ab/) or [Advisory Committee](https://www.w3.org/participate/meetings). Again, a Pull Request can wait until you have gained consensus with these two committees.\n\nYou can raise the issue with the [Process Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/w3process/), and you can suggest (or they will notice) that it needs policy discussion and refer it onwards. But you may prefer to initiate that discussion yourself.\n\nGetting something in front of both the [Advisory Board](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#AB) or [Advisory Committee](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#AC) can be tricky. If your organisation is a W3C member please let your Advisory Committee member know; they will then be able to email the Advisory Committee or bring the issue up at an Advisory Committee meeting. To reach the [Advisory Board](https://www.w3.org/2002/ab/) you can [raise an issue](/../../issues) on this repo (at least two AB members monitor this repo) or send an email to ab@w3.org.\n\nGaining consensus from the [Advisory Board](https://www.w3.org/2002/ab/) or [Advisory Committee](https://www.w3.org/participate/meetings) will take some time. After consensus has been reached you may either raise a `pull request` which include the changes agreed by these committees or wait for the Editor to make the required changes. See more details about `pull requests` below.\n\n## Edit and Pull Request Instructions\nThis is a very simple repository. To make an edit to the document simply edit the [index.html](index.html) file and send a pull request when your changes are done. If you have the rights to edit this repo your edits will need to be made on a new branch. If you do not have the rights to edit this repo please `fork` the repo, make your edits, then send a `pull request`.\n\nPull Requests should result in a correct-looking document (formats and lays out correctly).\n\n## Notes\nPlease feel free to suggest how this document can improve by [raising an issue](/../../issues) on this repo.\n",

Instead, fork the desired branch and submit a pull request.\n\n## Design guidelines\n\nSee [Guidelines for a proper design](https://github.com/w3c/tr-design/blob/gh-pages/README.md#guidelines-for-a-proper-design).\n\n## Mockups for the /TR page\n\n* [mockup #1](https://w3c.github.io/tr-pages/mockup1/)\n\n## Mockups for an outdated (deprecated) specification\n\n* Outdated:\n  * [HTML 4](https://w3c.github.io/tr-pages/outdatedspecsmockup/html4/)\n  * [HTML ARIA](https://w3c.github.io/tr-pages/outdatedspecsmockup/html-aria/)\n\nNote that we have different styles for rescinded and obsoleted specifications.

Please make branch names informative—by including the issue or bug number for example.\n\nEditorial changes that improve the readability of the spec or correct spelling or grammatical mistakes are welcome.\n\nPlease read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), about licensing contributions.\n\n## Tools\n\nGenerating weekly minutes is done via the\n[scribejs](https://github.com/w3c/scribejs) script and some additional\nconfiguration settings provided in this repo (see `.scribejs.json`).\n\nTo use this repository's scribejs setup first install the tools...\n\n```bash\n$ npm install\n```\n\nThen run the following (with date\ninformation changed to match your scenario):\n\n```bash\n$ npm run scribejs -- -d 2018-07-09 -o Meetings/Minutes/2018/2018-07-09-pwg.md\n```\n\nThis will request the IRC logs for the correct channel and convert them into\nthe Kramdown (a more feature rich form of Markdown) with settings to match this\nrepositories other documents.\n\nIf you need to make edits to the IRC log before generating the output (due to\nincorrect scribenick or similar), you can download the W3C logs from URLs such\nas `https://www.w3.org/2018/07/09-pwg-irc.txt`. Once downloaded, you can\nreference that input document directly (rather than using the automagic\ndate-based retrieval).\n\nFor example:\n\n```bash\n$ curl https://www.w3.org/2018/07/09-pwg-irc.txt > 2018-07-09-pwg-irc.txt\n$ npm run scribejs -- 2018-07-09-pwg-irc.txt -d 2018-07-09 -o Meetings/Minutes/2018/2018-07-09-pwg.md\n```\nEdit the .txt file and repeat the `npm run scribejs` line as necessary. Once\nfinished, you can commit the `.md` file and delete the `.txt` file (or keep it\nfor your records).\n"

Any W3C Group Chairs, Participants, Invited Experts and Members are welcome to join!_\n\n# Working Group Effectiveness Task Force\nMonthly call time 2pm UTC second Friday of the month. Natasha Rooney chairs.\n\nThe Working Group Effectiveness Task Force is a W3C AB organised task force which aims to assess and work on solutions to improve working group effectiveness in W3C working groups. \n\nThe Task Force was set up after the assessment of some working groups which, although producing well used technologies, were not able to complete their chartered specifications on time. In response, the [Common Standards Issues](CSI.md) document was created, which aimed to help working groups identify issues affecting their progress, and help them solve these. The creation of the [Common Standards Issues](CSI.md) document lead to the creation of this Task Force. \n\n## Task Force Members\n[dontcallmedom](https://github.com/dontcallmedom), [torgo](https://github.com/torgo), [astearns](https://github.com/astearns), [plehegar](https://github.com/plehegar) (**team contact**), [nrooney](https://github.com/nrooney) (**chair**), [jeffjaffe](https://github.com/jeffjaffe), [marcoscaceres](https://github.com/marcoscaceres), Paul Cotton, [Wendy Seltzer](https://github.com/wseltzer), [Leonie Watson](https://github.com/LJWatson), [Tzviya Siegman](https://github.com/TzviyaSiegman).\n\n## Outcomes\nThe group has agreed to work on the current outcomes. We have a number of outcomes, so a Phase 1 and a Phase 2 has been agreed.\n\n### Completed Documents\nThe Task Force has discussed [what makes a working group effective](wg_effective.md) and created a document to address this (possibly unanswerable!) question. The [attendee roles within a working group](wg_attendee_roles.md) document was also created, to indentify the various roles participants play in W3C groups (a non exhaustive list). Identifying these allows the Task Force to give advice and create solutions which allow all working group attendees to contribute to successful working groups.\n\n### [Chair Train] Chair Guidance and Sessions\nChair sessions including dedicated breakout sessions at TPAC which can be both information giving and sharing sessions. Task Force members can inform chairs as to the new available tools and information. Chairs can share information on what has and has not worked for them in their respective groups. TPAC usuaully has a chairs' breakfast presentation, in which the Task Force can present its findings. At TPAC 2017 it transpired that whilst finding chair training useful, chairs would prefer a buddy process, easy to find information, and sharing chairing responsibilities more useful. \n\n#### Buddy Process\nIn TPAC 2017 there was a huge support from chairs for a Buddy System. We're beginning to flesh out this idea in the [Buddy System](https://github.com/w3c/wg-effectiveness/blob/master/buddy_system.md). Please leave your thoughs for this in [Issue #43](https://github.com/w3c/wg-effectiveness/issues/43).\n\n#### Invigorating the Chair Mailing List\nThe Task Force is attempting to make the chair mailing a list a more useful tools for chairs to give advice, ask questions and share experiences. If you're a chair or task force member please feel free to start a new topic on the chair mailing list, or respond to already sent related mails.\n\n#### Co-Chairs\nA number of standards bodies operate a two-chair system for working groups. This allows a chair flexibiltiy, and a sharing of responsibilities. It also takes pressure off the team contact. The Task Force is discussing whether this would work for W3C.\n\n### [Guide] Updated /guide (Easy to Read and Access Information for New and Existing Attendees)\nUpdated guidance and information in an easy to find and access location for chairs, participants and implementers in how to work effectively in working groups. This information also needs regular assessing and updating as necessary. Currenly much of this information can be found in [The Art of Consensus: A Guidebook for W3C Group Chairs and Participants](https://www.w3.org/Guide/), this needs to be re-organised, redeisgned and must include:\n* information on how to effectively use tools\n  * including the effective use of GitHub\n* information for chairs, participants, implementers\n* information on testing\n* information for new chairs and new attendees on how to get started within W3C (perhaps including welcome emails and welcome pack)\n* updated look and feel - ask team who work on W3C spec design\n\nCurrently the Task Force is working on an Information Architecture for the Guide in the [W3C Guide Github Repo](#)\n\nThe Task Force is also discussing whether to align Working Group homepages to be consistent, aiding new and existing participants to navigate W3C Working Groups in a much easier way.\n\n### [Testing] Testing\nTesting has become an essential part of standards development, but it's taking a while for groups to get started with building testing into their standards development flow. The Task Force is working on the following:\n\n* Process: Currently \"implemenations\" are written into the process but not \"Testing\", even though they are both arguably as important as each other in standards development. The discussion on whether to include this is the W3C Process has moved to the [W3C Process Github Repo](https://github.com/w3c/w3process/issues/157).\n* Videos: many W3C Working Group chairs and participants agree that Testing is extremely important, but the big problem is how to get started. Some Task Force members are working on introductory videos on how to get started with testing, to get more people up and running faster.\n* Others: here are some other ideas we have for testing:\n  * Adding Test Details into /Guide: Detail types of tests that are required (e.g. interoperability, stress tests, security tests, etc)\n  * No Tests No Merge should become a GitHub rule for our tools / github related outputs\n  * Possible ombudspeople for testing.\n\n### [CSI] Common Standards Issues Document and Triage Process\nThe Task Force are continuing work on the [Common Standards Issues](https://github.com/w3c/wg-effectiveness/blob/master/CSI.md) Document. This will be presented to the AC at AC2018.\n\n### [Ombudspeople] Ombudspeople for Working Group Effectiveness with Guidelines for Escalation\nW3C currently has team contacts who can be approached with issues related to working group effectivness. This team should be reviewed (possibly adding some non team contacts) and promoted within the W3C. The team should have guidelines on what happens when issues need to be escalated. The task force will need to work on a flow. \n\n## Links to current chair/team resources:\nSee [Current Working Group Resources](current_wg_resources.md).\n"

Put your layouts in `_layouts`, your includes in `_includes`, your sass files in `_sass` and any other assets in `assets`.\n\nTo experiment with this code, add some sample content and run `bundle exec jekyll serve` – this directory is setup just like a Jekyll site!\n\nTODO: Delete this and the text above, and describe your gem\n\n\n## Installation\n\nAdd this line to your Jekyll site's `Gemfile`:\n\n```ruby\ngem \"wai-website-theme\"\n```\n\nAnd add this line to your Jekyll site's `_config.yml`:\n\n```yaml\ntheme: wai-website-theme\n```\n\nAnd then execute:\n\n    $ bundle\n\nOr install it yourself as:\n\n    $ gem install wai-website-theme\n\n## Usage\n\nTODO: Write usage instructions here. Describe your available layouts, includes, sass and/or assets.\n\n## Contributing\n\nBug reports and pull requests are welcome on GitHub at https://github.com/[USERNAME]/hello. This project is intended to be a safe, welcoming space for collaboration, and contributors are expected to adhere to the [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org) code of conduct.\n\n## Development\n\nTo set up your environment to develop this theme, run `bundle install`.\n\nYour theme is setup just like a normal Jekyll site! To test your theme, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and open your browser at `http://localhost:4000`. This starts a Jekyll server using your theme. Add pages, documents, data, etc. like normal to test your theme's contents. As you make modifications to your theme and to your content, your site will regenerate and you should see the changes in the browser after a refresh, just like normal.\n\nWhen your theme is released, only the files in `_layouts`, `_includes`, `_sass` and `assets` tracked with Git will be bundled.\nTo add a custom directory to your theme-gem, please edit the regexp in `wai-website-theme.gemspec` accordingly.\n\n## License\n\nThe theme is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).\n\n"

Such error reports should be processed no less frequently than quarterly. Readers of the Recommendation should be able easily to find and see the errata that apply to that specific Recommendation with their associated tests. Working Groups decide how to document errata. The best practice is a document that identifies itself as based on the Recommendation text and clearly identifies the errata and any proposed corrections; other approaches include various forms of an errata page, possibly auto-generated from a database.\n\nThis repository intends to harmonize how Groups document errata by establishing a workflow to process errors reported by readers and implementers and facilitates the update of errata pages.\n\nThe workflow described below is applicable to Recommendations maintained by Working Groups as well as Recommendations without a Working Group (the Working Group was closed). Note that a correction, created within the context of a Working Group or without one, can only become part of the Recommendation by the process for [Revising a Recommendation](https://www.w3.org/2018/Process-20180201/#errata).\n\n## This repository\n\nThis repository contains a simple file with some associated scripts to handle and document errata for published Recommendations. The \"model\" is as follows:\n\n* Errata are raised and managed in a GitHub repository (“errata repository” in what follows). This often means re-using the repository used by a Working Group, if one exists.  If one or more individuals wishes to use this model for a Recommendation which does not have a draft in the W3C GitHub repository, please send an inquiry to the [W3C webmaster](webreq@w3.org) so that they can create one for you.\n* There is a selected group of administrators (not only the team…) that can change the labels for issues in the repository.\n\nNote that the workflow describes the case whereby a single repository is used for several documents. In case the Working Group follows the separate repository per document model, an errata file must be installed separately for each document.\n\n## How does it work for the user\n\nRaising and managing errata is done as follows. Note that the approach below is for a case when the errata repository is used for several recommendations (identified by separate labels, `Model` and `Vocab` in the example below). Obviously, if a separate errata repository is used for separate documents, that approach can be simplified.\n\n* Errata are introduced and stored in the issue list of the dedicated repository. The workflow to add a new erratum is as follows:\n  * An issue is raised for a possible erratum. The label of the issue SHOULD be set to “`ErratumRaised`”. It SHOULD also include the label corresponding to the document on which the erratum is raised, e.g., “`Model`” or “`Vocab`”. It is o.k. for an erratum to have several labels. In some, exceptional, cases, i.e., when the erratum is very general, it is also acceptable not to have a reference to a document.\n  * The community discusses the issue. If it is accepted as a genuine erratum, the label “`Errata`” is added to the entry and the “`ErratumRaised`” label should be removed. Additionally, a new comment on the issue MAY be added, beginning with the word \"Summary:\" (if such a summary is useful based on the discussion).\n  * If the community rejects the issue as an erratum, the issue should be closed.\n  * Each errata may be labelled as “`Editorial`”; editorial errata are listed separately from the substantial ones. By default, an issue is considered substantive unless indicated otherwise.\n  * ALL substantive errata are generally expected to have corresponding test(s) (such as a pull request in [web-platforms-tests](https://github.com/web-platforms-tests/wpt)), either in the form of new tests or modifications to existing tests, or must include the rationale for why test updates are not required for the erratum.\n\nThat is it. When the `index.html` is fetched, it displays the list of accepted errata, possibly with a summary, and categorized by document. That `index.html` file can be used as the official errata reference in the Recommendation’s header.\n\n## How to contribute to the maintenance of a W3C Recommendation?\n\nWe would like to encourage the community at large to contribute to the maintenance of W3C Recommendations.  As long as the pull request contains an error that can be resolved by one or more changes in classes 1-3 of [section 6.2.5 Classes of Changes](https://www.w3.org/2018/Process-20180201/#correction-classes), anyone should be able to send a pull request to help fixing issues and consequently better matching the reality of implementations. If the pull request demonstrate usefulness and skills, we will be encouraged to grant commit access to the repository (see [The Pull Request Hack](https://felixge.de/2013/03/11/the-pull-request-hack.html)).\n\n## Installation\n\nThe `index.html` file must be adapted. Apart from the obvious changes (setting the right title, reference to the Working Group, etc), the following attribute values must be set in the source:\n\n* `@data-githubrepo`, to be set on the `<head>` element to the repository name. For W3C repositories the name is usually of the form `w3c/@@@`, though there are groups that use a different “organization”.\n* `@data-erratalabel` must be set _on each_ top level `<section>` elements, except for the last one, within the `<main>` element. The value should be the label used in the errata repository for the specific document. The last section should be left as is, used by possible errata that are not explicitly assigned to a document.\n\nIf an editor's draft is maintained to reflect the text of the published Recommendation amended to include approved errata, you should add a link to this document in the `index.html` file.\n\n## Examples\n\nThere is a ”test” version in this repository (it relies on the errata repository of the CSV on the Web WG):\n\nhttps://w3c.github.io/display_errata/test.html\n\nThere are also some past Working Groups that have been using the mechanism (though possibly earlier versions thereof), see:\n\n* CSV on the Web Working Group: https://www.w3.org/2013/csvw/errata/\n* Web Annotation Working Group: https://www.w3.org/annotation/errata/\n* Permissions & Obligations Expression Working Group: https://www.w3.org/2016/poe/errata/\n"

      "readme": "# i18n-tests\nThis repository contains most of the tests created for use with the W3C Internationalization test suite.  The majority test international features of W3C specifications, but there are others that just explore browser support for certain international features.\n\nThe tests and the test framework have been moved here from the W3C server, so that they are more easily accessible. The test framework was converted from PHP to run using JavaScript. Tests that require server-side settings, however, remain on the W3C server (these include character encoding and language tests that rely on HTTP headers).\n\nLinks on the [main test page](https://www.w3.org/International/tests/) take you to pages that show results for a group of related tests. Click on the links in the left column of those pages to view a test in the test runner.\n\nThe tests follow the pattern of the [Web Platform Tests](https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests), since it is our aim to copy all appropriate tests to that repository.  The i18n test suite is maintained separately because it contains exploratory tests that don't belong in the WPT repo, and because the tests and their results are arranged so that they can be linked to from educational materials created by the Internationalization activity.\n\nWe have some [guidelines for writing i18n tests](https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/wiki/Writing-i18n-tests) that complement the guidelines in the WPT documentation.\n\n## Notes on structure of the repo\n\nWe group tests into batches. There is typically one results page per batch, but sometimes one batch equates to more than one results page.  The results page is an HTML page that groups tests in some useful manner, using headings, provides a link to the individual test, the assertion, and a set of results for major browsers for that test.\n\nA batch file is a list of tests that make up a batch. To read a batch file, you need to know the base – this is the path from the root of the repo to the location of the tests as listed in the batch file.\n\nA batch file is associated with a .json file that contains information such as the assertion, title, etc. for each test in the batch.\n\nResults are stored in data.js files associated with each batch file. There’s a tool available for quickly merging new results with any existing ones.\n\n## Moving tests to the test framework\n\nThe process of adding new tests to the test framework is explained at https://w3c.github.io/i18n-tests/tools/PROCESS.html.  A local version of that page is used to actually run the process. You'll need PHP to run the various scripts called by that page (and therefore you'll need to run the page under localhost).\n\nThat page helps you with the following steps. In most cases it is just a question of ensuring you give the name and path for the batch and then press a button to generate files or data.\n\n1. setting up a batch file and associated data and json files once you have set of test files to add to the test framework\n2. running the tests to check that they work\n3. create a partially filled-out results file for the batch from a template\n4. add test results to the data file.\n\nThe first 3 steps are typically run together when adding a set of files to the repository and framework. Step 4 can be run any time you have results to add to the results page for a batch.\n\n\n## Porting tests to WPT\n\nThe WPT folks prefer script-based tests or ref tests, but will also accept manual tests when it's not possible to automate the test.  This is fairly common for i18n tests.  \n\nWe should try to ensure that tests we create are scripted or ref tests wherever possible, but we may also add 'workings' to the displayed file, rather than just show a green/red blob.  This is because our tests are also used for education, not only for nightly testing of browsers.\n\nIn some cases, we may need to change the way a test works before porting to WPT. For example, overlaying test text over red ref text often provides a very effective way for humans to spot differences (esp for tests with multiple components, such as text-transform tests), however there is some concern that occasional the subpixel bleeding of the red colour may interfere with the automated ref test mechanism.  In such cases we need to adapt the test before porting to WPT.  Hopefully, this will typically involve only removing some CSS statements (however, we need to check that).\n\nOnce a set of tests has been ported to WPT, we should track any changes to those tests, and if they are substantive we should retrofit the changes to the tests in our own repo.\n"

These tests were\ncontributed at various times by members of the XML Schema Working Group, and the\ntop-level organization is by original contributor.\n\nThe CVS history has not been preserved in the Github repository. However, the metadata\nassociated with tests includes change history in many cases.\n\nIn fact many of the individual files were not stored separately in CVS; they existed\nonly within a large ZIP file representing the test suite base line at some particular date.\nSubsequent changes to the tests (notably, all tests developed specifically for XSD 1.1)\nwere added to the repository individually.\n\n## Process\n\nTo gain commit access to this repository, please apply to Liam Quin at W3C.\n\nIf you have commit access, there is no formal process for agreeing changes to tests,\nbut you should respect the fact that the test suite is stable. Some tests are marked\nas \"queried\", which means the results have been challenged; these will normally include\na reference to a W3C bugzilla entry. If the bugzilla entry indicates consensus that a \nbug needs fixing, and on how it should be fixed, then feel free to apply the required\nchange. Otherwise, don't change any tests without gaining consensus from interested and\nknowledgeable parties.\n\nYou are welcome to add new tests. Just make sure you observe the process for documenting\nthem, and be prepared for them to be challenged.\n\n## Running the tests\n\nNo test driver is supplied; you are expected to write your own.\n\nThe file `suite.xml` contains links to `.testSet` files. Each `.testSet` file\ncontains a number of test groups; each test group typically contains a schema\nand one or more instances to be validated against that schema; both the schema\nand the instances are labeled as valid or invalid. A test driver should validate\nall the instances against the schema and confirm that the validity reported by\na schema processor is the same as that recorded in the test metadata.\n\nA schema for the test metadata, with additional documentation, can be found in\nthe file `nistMeta/annotatedTSSchema.xsd`.\n\nThe `introspection` test set checks that all the test metadata files are valid\nagainst the schema for test metadata.\n\nThe test suite only checks that the top-level outcome reported by a validator\n(valid or invalid) is correct. It makes no attempt to check for other conformance\nrequirements in the XSD specification: for example, that a correct PSVI is generated,\nor that error reporting meets the requirements of the specification.\n",

The link to the script does not appear in the generated HTML file (ie, the script is not needed for the final publication).\n\n### Add an ORCID reference to authors/editors\n\nThe author and/or editor structure should contain two entries: `w3cid` (the identifier of the person at W3C, used for other purposes as well), and `orcid`, that contains the person’s ORCID ID. For example:\n\n```\neditors: [\n    {\n  \t\t...\n    },\n    {\n        \"name\": \"Ivan Herman\",\n        ...,\n        \"w3cid\": 7382,\n        \"orcid\": \"0000-0003-0782-2704\"\n    },\n    ...\n\n],\n\n```\n\n\n(The value of `w3cid` can be found, for example, on [one’s W3C user profile](https://www.w3.org/users/myprofile).)\n\n### Styling the output\n\nThe script generates the following structure into the DOM tree:\n\n```\n<span class=\"orcid\"><a href=\"https://orcid.org/ORCIDID\"><img src=\"https://orcid.org/sites/default/files/images/orcid_16x16.gif\"></a></span>\n```\n\n\nIe, using the `orcid` class the output can be styles. A typical CSS statement may be:\n\n\n```\nspan.orcid a {\n\tborder-bottom: none !important;\n}\n```\n\nTo avoid a bottom border on the ORCID logo.\n\n---\n\nIvan Herman, <ivan@w3.org>, 2018\n\nCopyright (c) 2018 W3C® (MIT, ERCIM, Keio, Beihang).

See also the related [Minimum PDDI Information Ontology](https://github.com/MPIO-Developers/MPIO/) project.\n\n- Decision-trees - documents that hold the exemplar potential drug-drug interactions PDDI used to build and validate the minimum information model. There is a single document for each PDDI. Each document provides a description of the PDDI, a decision trees for the clinical context, and references \n\n- Med-Rec-Use-Case - documents describing the medication reconciliation use case used to validate the minimum informaton model\n\n- Stakeholder-descriptions - documents that define the intended users of the minimum information model and provide specific user stories for each intended user\n\n- Presentations - presentations related to the minimum information model\n\n- src - Source code used to demonstrate the minimum information model\n\n## Overview:\n\nObjectives: Develop a minimal information model for drug interaction\nevidence and knowledge as part of an Health Information Technology\nstandard like HL7. These include the following activities:\n\n- Clarify definitions for the minimum information items recommended by the relevant stakeholders. See also the related [Minimum PDDI Information Ontology](https://github.com/MPIO-Developers/MPIO/) project.\n\n- Propose additional attributes that further specify information relevant for each of the seven information items (e.g., \"what is the basic information that should be provided when discussing clinical consequences, frequency of harm and exposures, etc.)\n\n- Create deliverables using an interesting and non-trivial set of potential drug-drug interactions:\n\n   -- Data Model: A data model (schema) for potential drug interaction knowledge and evidence\n\n   -- Vocabulary: A precise vocabulary describing/defining the data model\n\n   -- Serializations: one or more serialization formats of the abstract\n   data model, such as XML, JSON/JSON-LD, Structured Product Labeling (HL7 CDA),\n   \n\n- Demonstration of how the minimum information model can support medication reconciliation \n\n- Create a foundation for further collaborative work by disseminating results through an interest group note, a website, and an online discussion forum\n\n## Possible workflow and application models for the PDDI minimal information model:\n\n![alt text](https://github.com/W3C-HCLS/w3c-ddi/raw/master/Presentations/images/info-model-value-proposition.png \"Possible workflow and application models for the PDDI minimal information model.\")\n\n## Contributors\n- [rkboyce](https://github.com/rkboyce)\n- [ericprud](https://github.com/ericprud)\n"

Here are some notes on modifying the content:\n\n- The template is to be used in conjunction with [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). This means that the main content of the pages are provided in Markdown (to be more precise, a dialect called [“Kramdown”](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html)), and jekyll would convert those on the server side into a static Web site. You can install jekyll locally (which is probably a good idea for testing), but the best way of deploying the website is to keep it as a github repository, turning on the `Settings/Github Pages` option. Jekyll is automatically ran by github, and the Web site will be available as a `https://w3c.github.io/yourreponame/index.html` (provided that cloned repository is kept within the W3C organization).\n- The jekyll site generation is based on template HTML files in the `_layouts` folder, and may refer to html snippets in the `_includes` folder. Many of the changes (sponsors, title of the workshop, etc.) must be done in those files.\n- The class `todo` has been used for all things that must be finalized eventually. These are displayed with a yellow background in the template. (Note that the Kramdown specific `{: .todo}` syntax is also used time-to-time in the Kramdown files to set the class.)\n- The “draft” watermark is generated via an SVG code incorporated in the CSS style in the `_layout` files. Obviously, this should be removed when the web site is final.\n- You may want to use a bona fide W3C URL for the workshop; this can be done by setting a redirection to the `github.io` page. Do a `curl` on, for example, `https://www.w3.org/publishing/.htaccess` for a pattern.\n\nYou can look at this template, served as HTML after jekyll has done its job at the corresponding `github.io` page: https://w3c.github.io/ws-homepage-template/index.html.\n\n## Testing locally\n\nThe repository content (or a clone thereof) can be tested locally by running [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) locally (see [jekyll's start docu](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/)). Note that running jekyll locally requires the presence of the `Gemfile` and `Gemfile.lock` files which are generated when initializing a local jekyll site. Because these files are usually put on the `.gitignore` (or `~/.gitignore_global`) files (ie, they are ignored by git), a \"template\" versions of these files have been put on the repository if you want to bypass the \"official\" installation steps.\n\n\n---\n\nIvan Herman, ivan@w3.org\n"

It allows the standards development organization to maintain vendor neutral control over a specification, and thus protect the consensus found within a Working Group.\n\nIn the course of the development of materials within the W3C, Task Force Participants will make contributions. Those contributions will be integrated into the jointly developed work thus creating shared copyright on the Task Force Participant's contribution. Most W3C Specifications contain a section with acknowledgement of contributions.\n\nTask Force Participants grant to the W3C a perpetual, nonexclusive, royalty-free, world-wide right and license under any Task Force Participant's copyrights on his or her contributions, to copy, publish and distribute the contribution under a license of W3C's choosing. Additionally, the Task Force Participant grants a right and license of the same scope to any derivative works prepared by the W3C and based on, or incorporating all or part of, his or her contribution and that any derivative works of this contribution prepared by the W3C shall be solely owned by the W3C. Furthermore, the Task Force Participant understands that W3C will be able to exercise all rights as a copyright owner of Task Force Participant's contribution, including enforcement against infringers without additional agreement or notice.\n\nNothing in this agreement restricts the Task Force Participant from using their individual contributions as they wish, even if those have later been amalgamated into joint works. Where W3C releases materials under a permissive license such as the W3C Software License or CC-BY, nothing in this agreement should be read to restrict the Task Force Participant from exercising the permissions granted by that license. The Task Force Participant represents that they are legally entitled to grant the above license. If their employer(s) have rights to intellectual property that the Task Force Participant creates that includes the contributions, they represent that they have received permission to make contributions on behalf of that employer or that the employer has waived such rights for the contributions to W3C.\n\n\n## Decency\n\nThe Task Force Participant will participate in the W3C Group in a decent way. Task Force Participants will refrain from defaming, harassing or otherwise offending other participants. The [Section 3.1 of the Process Document](https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#ParticipationCriteria) applies, as does the W3C [Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/).\n\nThe Task Force Participant will refrain from sending unsolicited commercial messages to W3C mailing-lists and other promotional activities for personal matters or for third parties. This is especially required from Task Force Participants sending messages to public W3C Groups.\n",
      "readme": "# Southeast Asian Layout task force\n\nThis group exists to allow a network of experts to share information about gaps and requirements for support of Southeast Asian scripts on the Web and in eBooks. \n\nThe main problem we seem to face at the moment is that experts don't know how to tell the W3C what problems exist for support of their script on the Web, and the W3C doesn't know how to contact people who can help when questions arise. This network of experts should help to significantly reduce that problem. \n\nSome experts may go a step further, and contribute to a gap-analysis or requirements document for a given script.\n\nTopics for discussion are suggested by [the gap-analysis template](http://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/templates/gap-analysis/gap-analysis_template.html). This work supports the development of the [matrix](http://w3c.github.io/typography/gap-analysis/language-matrix.html) indicating hot-spots for language support.\n\n### Documents\n- [Lao Layout Requirements](https://w3c.github.io/sealreq/lao/) (early draft)\n- [Lao Script Gap Analysis](https://w3c.github.io/sealreq/gap-analysis/laoo-gap.html)\n- [Thai Layout Requirements](https://w3c.github.io/sealreq/thai/) (early draft)\n- [Khmer Script Gap Analysis](https://w3c.github.io/sealreq/gap-analysis/khmr-gap.html)\n- [Khmer Layout Requirements](https://w3c.github.io/sealreq/khmer/) (early draft)\n- [Javanese Script Gap Analysis](https://w3c.github.io/sealreq/gap-analysis/java-gap.html)\n- [Javanese Layout Requirements](https://w3c.github.io/sealreq/javanese/) (early draft)\n\n### Feedback\nPlease use the [GitHub issue list](https://github.com/w3c/sealreq/issues) to report issues for language support, for discussions, and to send feedback about documents.\n\n### Following\nRather than just 'Watch' this repository, it is best to subscribe to the [public-i18n-sea](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-i18n-sea/) mailing list. That list is notified once a day (in digest form) about not only changes to this repository, but also about other W3C Working Group issues related to Southeast Asian writing systems. (Please use github issues rather than the mailing list to send feedback.)\n\nYou can find a list of open issues, including those from Working Groups, on the [Layout Tracker](http://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/textlayout/?filter=seasia) page. (That link applies a seasia filter.)\n\n### Contributing\nAll contributors should read and agree with [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nGroup _members_ are expert contributors who provide advice on requirements and gaps for the script they are familiar with. Some may also participate actively in producing the work of the group, contributing text and advice to create the outputs, and participating in meetings. For more information about becoming a group member contact [Richard Ishida](mailto:ishida@w3.org).

There is a separate [list of repos of this WG](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Ajson-ld-wg+org%3Aw3c&type=Repositories).\n\nAll repositories for spec development share the same set of labels; inspired by the [labels organized for W3C specification](https://w3c.github.io/issue-metadata.html).\n\n## Contributing to the JSON-LD Working Group Repositories\n\nUse the standard fork, branch, and pull request workflow to propose changes to the specification. Please make branch names informative—by including the issue or bug number for example.\n\nEditorial changes that improve the readability of the spec or correct spelling or grammatical mistakes are welcome.\n\nPlease read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), about licensing contributions.\n\n## Tools\n\nGenerating weekly minutes is done via the\n[scribejs](https://github.com/w3c/scribejs) script and some additional\nconfiguration settings provided in this repo (see `.scribejs.json`).\n\nTo use this repository's scribejs setup first install the tools...\n\n```bash\n$ npm install\n```\n\nThen run the following (with date\ninformation changed to match your scenario):\n\n```bash\n$ npm run scribejs -- -d 2018-07-06 -o _minutes/2018-07-06-json-ld.md\n```\n\nThis will request the IRC logs for the correct channel and convert them into\nthe Kramdown (a more feature rich form of Markdown) with settings to match this\nrepositories other documents.\n\nIf you need to make edits to the IRC log before generating the output (due to\nincorrect scribenick or similar), you can download the W3C logs from URLs such\nas `https://www.w3.org/2018/07/06-json-ld-irc.txt`. Once downloaded, you can\nreference that input document directly (rather than using the automagic\ndate-based retrieval).\n\nFor example:\n\n```bash\n$ curl https://www.w3.org/2018/07/06-json-ld-irc.txt > 2018-07-06-json-ld-irc.txt\n$ npm run scribejs -- 2018-07-06-json-ld-irc.txt -d 2018-07-06 -o _minutes/2018-07-06-json-ld.md\n```\nEdit the .txt file and repeat the `npm run scribejs` line as necessary. Once\nfinished, you can commit the `.md` file and delete the `.txt` file (or keep it\nfor your records).\n\n### Jekyll\n\nThis site is built for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). If you have Jekyll\nand npm installed, you can run `npm run serve` to have Jekyll watch the\nworking directory for changes and compile the templates (etc) incrementally.\n\nOnce run, you can browse the site at `http://localhost:4000/2018/json-ld-wg/`\n(the extra path information is *required* to match the w3.org hosting location).\n"

      "readme": "# wai-statements\n\nAccessibility Statement generator tool pages are a part of the WAI website and therefore makes use of the [wai-website-theme](https://github.com/w3c/wai-website-theme) as dependency. Both make use of [Jekyll static site generator](https://jekyllrb.com/) to create the pages.\n\n- Github page: https://w3c.github.io/wai-statements/planning/statements/\n\n- [Requirements](https://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/wiki/Accessibility_Statements_Requirements)\n\n---\n\n## Installation and local development\n\n### Installation as part of the WAI website\n\nThis site is build with Jekyll, [follow Jekyll's installation guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) first.\n\nThen clone this repository:\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/w3c/wai-statements.git\n```\n\nIf you have installed ruby and jekyll, cd into the project and install dependencies defined inside the `Gemfile`:\n\n```\nbundle install\n```\n\nNow you can start development with:\n\n```\nbundle exec jekyll serve\n```\n\n\n### Installation as stand-alone\n\nTo use the accessibility statement generator tool as a stand-alone to include into your own site you need to build the site once with Jekyll, see \"[Installation as part of the WAI website](#installation-as-part-of-the-wai-website)\".\n\nBuild the site:\n```\nbundle exec jekyll build\n```\n\nThe complete site is build inside the `_site` folder and the generated files you need will be:\n\n- HTML: `planning/statements/generator/index.html`\n\n    You will need all contents of `<div id=\"accstatement\">` and link to required css and javascript below. The rest is all WAI website material.\n\n- CSS: `content-images/wai-statements/generator.css`\n- JS: `content-images/wai-statements/generator.js`\n- WAI theme assets: `assets/css/style.css` and `assets/scripts/main.js`\n\n    This is required for the expanding and toggling of sections and information.\n\nFor now you need to strip and modify all files manually to make it includeable into your own project.\n\n#### TODO for stand alone version\n\n- [ ] Add standalone version page `generator/standalone.html`\n\n\n\n---\n\n## Customizing the generator tool\n\n### Add, remove and update content\n\nThe generator tool is setup in such a way that content is seperated from function. In this way, adding and removing form or preview content is easy to do. Addition is only required inside the `generator.html` file.\n\n#### Editing the statement create form\n\nThe create statement contents are wrapped inside `<section class=\"page create\">`. Just simply add or remove the html markup to edit the form.\n\nThere is one extra functionality available to dynamically add extra line to grouped form input; add-line. To use this there are several practical examples inside the form. Required for add-line to work is this basic setup:\n\n```html\n<fieldset class=\"group\">\n    <legend>An add-line input group</legend>\n\n    <!--\n        OPTIONAL: Pre defined lines\n        class line is optional and will determine the count start\n    -->\n    <div class=\"field line\">\n        <label for=\"some_addline_item_1\">Some addline item 1</label>\n        <input type=\"text\" id=\"some_addline_item_1\" name=\"an_addline_grouping_name\" />\n    </div>\n\n    <!--\n        REQUIRED: A prototype declared\n        class proto required\n        [n] = placeholder for the line count\n    -->\n    <div class=\"field proto\">\n        <label for=\"some_addline_item_[n]\">Some addline item [n]</label>\n        <input type=\"text\" id=\"some_addline_item_[n]\" name=\"an_addline_grouping_name\" />\n    </div>\n\n    <!--\n        REQUIRED: An add-line button\n        To add the proto to the fieldset as line\n    -->\n    <button type=\"button\" class=\"add-line\">\n        Add another line\n    </button>\n</fieldset>\n```\n\n#### Editing the statement preview\n\nThe preview statement contents are wrapped inside `<section class=\"page preview\">`. Just simply add or remove the html markup to edit the form.\n\nSame as with [editing the statement create form](#editing-the-statement-create-form), just add or remove html markup to edit the statement preview.\n\nTo print the form data into the statement preview there is some additional functionality available:\n\n- Printing formdata with `data-print` attribute:\n\n    Example print usage:\n    ```html\n    <!--\n        Single input data\n        data-print          REQUIRED    input id to print\n        data-printdefault   OPTIONAL    defaultvalue if data is missing or empty\n        data-printfilter    OPTIONAL    Output transformation; one of [lowercase, capitalize]\n    -->\n    <span data-print=\"forminput_id\" data-printdefault=\"MY_FORM_DATA\" data-printfilter=\"lowercase, capitalize\"></span>\n\n    <!--\n        Print as url\n        The data entered will also be outputted into the href\n        and can be prefixed like “mailto:” for example.\n    -->\n    <a href=\"URL_PREFIX\" data-print=\"some_url_data\"></a>\n\n    <!--\n        Print Grouped data:\n        UL or OL\n        Grouped data is stored under the group name\n        defined as name on input elements\n        Filters added are applied for each data item inside the group\n    -->\n    <ul data-print=\"some_grouped_data\"></ul>\n    ```\n\n- Conditionally show sections with `data-if` attribute:\n\n    To make the statement preview show sections based on filled form inputs / groups, you can wrap contents with a conditional element and / or include a condition to an element like:\n\n    ```html\n    <!-- Wrapped inside condition -->\n    <div data-if=\"required_data_id\">\n        <!-- Content will be visible based on available data -->\n    </div>\n\n    <!-- Or part of section -->\n    <div>\n        <!-- Other content … -->\n        <p data-if=\"some_data\">\n            This text will be shown if some_data is present.\n        </p>\n    </div>\n\n    <!-- Depending on multiple data sources -->\n    <div data-if=\"this_data, that_data\">\n        <!-- Stays hidden until one of data sources is present -->\n    </div>\n    ```\n\n#### Exceptions\n\nCurrently custom handled statement parts are:\n\n- Conformance meaning data (Updates to hidden input #accstmnt_conformance_meaning)\n- Limitations section (Still reading directly from DOM)\n\nWhen changes are required here edits on generator.js are necessary.\n\n\n### Internationalization\n\nCurrently this application does not support easy translation. For now you need to duplicate the `generator.html` file and rename both something like `generator_en.html` and `generator_fr.html`. Then just edit the contents manually.\n\nContents for the create page (form) are wrapped in `<section class=\"page create\">`, preview inside `<section class=\"page preview\">`.\n"

      "readme": "# TTML2 Test Suites\n\nThe TTML2 Test Suites consist of a validation test suite and a presentation test suite. The purpose of these test suites is to demonstrate adequate implementation experience of each (designated) feature of the [TTML2 Specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/ttml2/) as documented by the [TTML2 Implementation Report](https://www.w3.org/wiki/TimedText/TTML2ImplementationReport). An ancillary purpose is to promote ineroperability between implementations.\n\nThe tests found in these test suites focus on functionality and constraints thereof that derive directly from normative text in the [TTML2 Specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/ttml2/). Additional tests that go beyond the normative specification text are included here as well; however, though such tests are useful for wider interoperability testing, the results from their exercise are not reported in the [TTML2 Implementation Report](https://www.w3.org/wiki/TimedText/TTML2ImplementationReport). See also [Excluded Tests](#excluded-tests).\n\n## Validation Test Suite\n\nThe validation test suite is found under the `validation` directory, and is divided into two parts: (1) tests for valid content (validity tests) and (2) tests for invalid content (invalidity tests). The result of each test can be characterized as PASS or FAIL.\n\nA PASS result for a validity test occurs if the validator does not reject (report a validation error for) the content of the test. In contrast, a FAIL result for a validity test occurs if the validator rejects (reports a validation error for) the content of the test, in which case, such a result is deemed a _false negative_ result.\n\nA PASS result for an invalidity test occcurs if the validator rejects (reports a validation error for) the content of the test. In contrast, a FAIL result for an invalidity test occurs if the validator does not reject (report a validation error for) the content of the test, in which case, such a result is deemed a _false positive_ result.\n\nA validator is considered to **_strictly pass_** the test suite if it does not report a false negative for any validity test. A validator is considered to **_fully pass_** the test suite if it (1) strictly passes the test suite and (2) does not report a false positive for any invalidity test.\n\nFor the purpose of reporting an implementation of the validation function for a specific (designated) feature, the implementation must strictly pass all tests for that feature; however, it is not required to fully pass all tests for that feature since the TTML2 specification does not require a validator to detect all possibile invalidities, about which see [validate document](https://www.w3.org/TR/ttml2/#semantics-procedure-validate-document).\n\nA mapping from (designated) features to specific tests is found in `validation/tests.json`, which, for each new TTML2 feature designator, lists validity and invalidity tests (by name), and optionally includes a per-test exclusion flag if the test is intended to be excluded from exit criteria consideration. We refer to this mapping file as the *validation test manifest*.\n\n## Presentation Test Suite\n\nThe presentation test suite is found under the `presentation` directory, and is divided into two parts: (1) tests for presenting valid content and (2) tests for presenting invalid content.\n\nA mapping from (designated) features to specific tests is found in `presentation/tests.json`, which, for each new TTML2 feature designator, lists presentation tests (by name), and optionally includes a per-test exclusion flag if the test is intended to be excluded from exit criteria consideration. We refer to this mapping file as the *presentation test manifest*.\n\nFor tests having primarily visual presentation semantics, each presentation test is associated with a like named ZIP archive with the suffix `.expected.zip`, which contains the output of a particular reference implementation (TTPE). Each such _reference archive_ contains a manifest file and one or more image frames represented in some image format. In the present form of the reference archives, the image format is `image/svg+xml`. These image frames should **not** be construed as normative, but merely serve as a possible reference image for performing (human visual) comparisons of expected output.\n\n## Excluded Tests\n\nAs noted above, the two (validation and presentation) test manifests employ an *exclusion* flag to denote that a test is excluded from exit criteria consideration. The tests marked as excluded (presently) consist of tests that may be useful for testing implementations, but are not necessarily derived from normative specification language, as well as tests for which there is some question as to whether they correctly represent normative specification requirements. In both cases, these tests may, but need not be exercised by implementations, and there is no expectation that the results from such tests will be reported by implementors.\n\n## Pending Tests\n\nTests located in the `pending` directory are under consideration for future addition to the test suite. They are not considered part of the formal test suite at this time; furthermore, there is no (fixed) schedule for their addition (or not) to the test suite.\n\n## Test Annotation Attributes\n\nIn addition to standard, TTML2 defined attributes, each test contains certain tool-specific annotation attributes in a namespace associated with the `ttva` prefix. These attributes are used by a certain reference implementation, [TTV](https://github.com/skynav/ttt/tree/master/ttt-ttv), to facilitate the testing process. Note that TTML2 content processing requires processors to prune (ignore) unrecognized namespace qualified attributes. See [Annotations](https://github.com/skynav/ttt/tree/master/ttt-ttv#annotations) for further information on their usage.\n",

Source files for WCAG 2.0 are in the wcag20 folder and exists primarily for archival purposes. Do not edit content in that folder.\n\nContent for WCAG 2.1 and later is organized accordign to the file structure below. The WCAG repository contains source and auxiliary files for WCAG 2, Understanding WCAG 2, and eventually techniques. It also contains auxiliary files that support automated formatting of the document. To facilitate multi-party editing, each success criterion is in a separate file, consisting of a HTML fragment that can be included into the main guidelines. Key files include:\n\n* guidelines/index.html - the main guidelines file\n* guidelines/sc/<version>/*.html - files for each success criterion\n* guidelines/terms/<version>/*.html - files for each definition\n* understanding/<version>/*.html - understanding files for each success criterion\n\nWhere <version> is \"20\", content came from WCAG 2.0. \"21\" is used for content introduced in WCAG 2.1, \"22\" for WCAG 2.2, etc.\n\n## Editing Draft Success Criteria\n\n[Success Criteria Managers](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wiki/SC_Managers_Phase1) will prepare candidate success criteria, ready for inclusion in the guidelines document. To prepare success criteria, follow these steps:\n\n1. [Clone the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/), using the URI https://github.com/w3c/wcag21.git to clone.\n1. Switch to the working branch for the proposal, which is named for the shortname of the draft success criterion and the issue number, concatenated together.\n1. Find the appropriate file for the success criterion in the guidelines/sc/21 folder, named the same as the start of the branch name, and open in an HTML-capable editor. Do the same with any definitions referenced by the success criterion, in the guidelines/terms/21 folder.\n1. Open the guidelines/index.html file and remove comment marks around the lines that reference the success criterion and terms you have edited..\n1. Follow the [success criteria format](#user-content-success-criteria-format) below to create the SC content.\n1. Save the file and commit the change. NOTE: It is important to also add a suitable 'commit message'. In the comments, reference the issue number from which the proposal was developed starting with a hash, e.g., `#1`. \n1. When the success criterion is ready for Working Group review, inform the chairs. Once the proposal has been accepted by the Working Group, the editors will merge the working branch into the master branch, which puts it in the editors' draft and eventual Technical Report publication.\n\n### Success Criteria Format\n\nSuccess criteria use a simple structure of HTML elements, with a few class attribute values, to ensure consistency. Enhancement scripts and style key off this structure. Content you provide is indicated in braces. Items after comments are optional.\n\n```html\n<section class=\"sc\">\n\t<h4>{SC Handle}</h4>\n\t<p class=\"conformance-level\">{Level}</p>\n\t<p class=\"change\">{Change}</p>\n\t<p>{Main SC Text}</p>\n\t<!-- if SC has sub-points -->\n\t<dl>\n\t\t<dt>{Point Handle}</dt>\n\t\t<dd>{Point Text}</dd>\n\t</dl>\n\t<!-- if SC has notes -->\n\t<p class=\"note\">{Note}</p>\n</section>\n```\n\nNote you do not provide the SC number. Numbers will be assigned, and most likely automatically generated, later.\n\nValues you provide are described below. Refer to [Success Criterion 2.2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#time-limits-required-behaviors) for an example of each of these pieces of content.\n\n<dl>\n\t<dt>{SC Handle}</dt>\n\t<dd>The short name of the SC. In SC 2.2.1 this is \"Timing Adjustable\".</dd>\n\t<dt>{Level}</dt>\n\t<dd>The conformance level of the SC. Values can be \"A\", \"AA\", or \"AAA\". Do not include the word \"Level\".</dd>\n\t<dt>{Change}</dt>\n\t<dd>Indicate whether the SC is unchanged from WCAG 2.0, changed, or new. Values can be \"Unchanged\", \"Changed\", or \"New\".</dd>\n\t<dt>{Main SC Text}</dt>\n\t<dd>The main text of the SC, or the starting paragraph. In SC 2.2.1 this is the content that begins \"For each time limit...\".</dd>\n\t<dt>{Point Handle}</dt>\n\t<dd>If the SC has bullets, each bullet has a handle. In SC 2.2.1 the first bullet point handle is \"Turn off\".</dd>\n\t<dt>{Point Text}</dt>\n\t<dd>The content of the bullet. In SC 2.2.1 the first bullet point text begins \"The user is allowed...\".</dd>\n\t<dt>{Note}</dt>\n\t<dd>If there is a note to the SC, provide it after the other content (without the starter \"Note\"). In SC 2.2.1, this is the content that begins \"This success criterion...\". If there is more than one note, multiple `<p class=\"note\">`elements may be provided.</dd>\n</dl>\n\n### Definitions\n\nIf you providing term definitions along with your SC, include them in the glossary. Position them in the appropriate alphabetical order with the rest of the terms and use the following format:\n\n```html\n<dt><dfn>{Term}</dfn></dt>\n<dd>{Definition}</dd>\n```\n\nThe ```dfn``` element tells the script that this is a term and causes special styling and linking features. To link to a term, use an `<a>` element without an `href` attribute; if the link text is the same as the term, the link will be correctly generated. For example, if there is a term `<dfn>web page</dfn>` on the page, a link in the form of `<a>web page</a>` will result in a proper link. If the link text has a different form from the canonical term, e.g., \"web pages\" (note the plural), you can provide a hint on the term definition with the `data-lt` attribute. In this example, modify the term to be `<dfn data-lt=\"web pages\">web page</dfn>`. Multiple alternate names for the term can be separated with pipe characters, with no leading or trailing space, e.g., `<dfn data-lt=\"web pages|page|pages\">web page</dfn>`.\n\n## Editing Draft Understanding Content\n\nThere is one Understanding file per success criterion, plus an index:\n\n* understanding/index.html - index page, need to uncomment or add a reference to individual Understanding pages as they are made available\n* understanding/<version>/*.html - files for each understanding page, named the same as the success criterion file in the guidelines\n\nFiles are populated with a template that provides the expected structure. Leave the template structure in place, and add content as appropriate within the sections. Elements with class=\"instructions\" provide guidance about what content to include in that section; you can remove those elements if you want but don't have to. The template for examples proposes either a bullet list or a series of sub-sections, choose one of those approaches and remove the other from the template. The template for techniques includes sub-sections for \"situations\", remove that wrapper section if not needed.\n\nUnderstanding files are referenced from the relevant Success Criterion on the WCAG specification; these links are put in by the script.\n\nThe formal publication location for Understanding pages is currently https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/. This content is updated as needed; and may be automated.\n\n## Editing Techniques\n\nTechniques are in the techniques folder, and grouped by technology into sub-folders. Each technique is a standalone file, which is in HTML format with a regular structure of elements, classes, and ids. Techniques previously published for WCAG 2.0 are currently have the assigned ID of the technique as the filename, but new techniques should use a filename that is derived from a shortened version of the technique title. \n\nFor example, a technique \"Using the alt attribute on the img element to provide short text alternatives\" might use \"img-alt-short-text-alternatives.html\" as the filename.\n\n### Create Techniques\n\n* Determine a filename for the technique that is likely to be descriptive, unique, and short.\n* Create a working branch named the same as the technique filename.\n* Copy the techniques/technique-template.html file into the appropriate technology folder for the technique, and give it the chosen file name.\n* In the section element with id \"meta\", indicate to which guideline or success criterion the technique relates, and whether the technique is sufficient, advisory, or a failure for that item. Multiple applicability are allowed.\n* Populate the template with appropriate content, using other techniques as examples for code formatting choices. Keep the existing structural sections from the template in place.\n* When the technique is ready for review, ask the chairs to arrange WG review and merge.\n* If you wish to reference the draft technique from an Understanding document, use the technique's rawgit URI.\n* After a technique is approved, the chairs will assign it an ID and update links to it in the Undestanding documents. \n\n### Provide Working Examples of Techniques\n\nExamples in techniques should be brief easy-to-consume code samples of how the technique is used in content. Therefore examples should focus on the specific features the technique describes, and not include related content such as style, script, surrounding web content, etc.\n\nOften it is desirable to provide more comprehensive examples, which show the technique in action while not interfering with the main technique document. These examples also show the complete code required to make the technique operate, including full style and script files, images, page code, etc. Usually, these \"working examples\" are referenced at the bottom of the elided example which is included in the main technique.\n\nWorking examples are stored in the `working-examples` directory of the repository. Each example is in its own subdirectory, to contain the multiple files that may be necessary to make the example work. In some cases, multiple working examples will share common resources; these are stored in the appropriate sub-directory of the working-examples directory, e.g., `working-examples/css`, `working-examples/img`, `working-examples/script`. Reference these common resources when available; otherwise place resources in the working example directory, using subdirectories to organize when appropriate.\n\nTo create a working example:\n\n* Identify the name for the example, e.g., \"Using the alt attribute\".\n* Create a working branch for the example, whose name begins with the prefix `example-` and which otherwise semantically identifies the example, e.g., `example-alt-attribute`.\n* Create a directory for the example inside the working examples directory, using the semantic name for the example minus the prefix used in the branch name, e.g., `working-examples/alt-attribute/`.\n* If the primary example is HTML, name the file `index.html`. Otherwise, create a suitable file name.\n* Refer to resources shared among multiple examples using relative links, e.g., `../css/example.css`. Place other resources in the same directory as the main example, e.g., `working-examples/alt-attribute/css/alt.css`.\n* Reference working examples from techniques using the rawgit URI to the example in its development branch, e.g., `https://rawgit.com/w3c/wcag/master/working-examples/alt-attribute/`. Editors will update links when examples are approved.\n* When the example is complete and functional, submit a pull request into the master branch.\n",

      "contributing": "Since we are a lot of people contributing to the specification, we have defined a few guidelines. Please follow them and we will be able to review your PR a lot faster when we don't have to point out style and other non-technical issues. Thank you.\n\n### W3C Legal\nContributions to this repository are intended to become part of Recommendation-track documents governed by the\n[W3C Patent Policy](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy-20040205/) and\n[Document License](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/copyright-documents). To bring substantive contributions to specifications, you must either participate\nin the relevant W3C Working Group or make a non-member patent licensing commitment.\n\nIf you are not the sole contributor to a contribution (pull request), please identify all contributors in the \ncommit message. In the commit, please include on a new line,\n<pre>Contributors: +@githubusername1, +@githubusername2, ...</pre>\n\n### 80 Characters\nFormat new text to break each line within 80 characters. If you add a few new words to an existing paragraph, it's OK if that line exceeds 80 characters. If fixing the width means that the next line gets to wide, and so on, it's better to leave it since touching a lot of lines unrelated to the actual fix makes the PR harder to review. We will make automatic re-flows of the document every once in a while.\n\n### Pull Request Names\nChoose a name for your PR that would make sense in a change log.  \nExample: Add support for new attribute X on Y (fixes: #123).  \nAvoid: Fix for #123.\n\n### Linked Names\nMake names of interfaces, enums and other identifiers clickable like this ```<code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code>```.\n\n### JSEP References\nReference specific sections of JSEP where possible. The syntax looks like this:  \n```<span data-jsep=\"initial-offers initial-answers\">[[!JSEP]]</span>```  \nSection aliases, to be used as data-jsep values, are found in [jsep-mapping/map.json](jsep-mapping/map.json). Information on how to update the map is found in [jsep-mapping/README.md](jsep-mapping/README.md).\n\n### Refactoring: Moving Text\nIf your PR needs to both move a section of text and update it, please do these operations in two separate commits (or even PRs). That will make the review process simpler.\n\n### Run Linter on Examples\nIf you have made a lot of changes to the example code snippets it might be a good idea to run the example linter. For instructions, see https://github.com/w3c/webrtc-respec-ci/blob/master/check-examples/README.md\n\n### Style Conventions\n\n**Strings**. Use quotes and enclose in code tags (to distinguish strings literals from quoted prose).\nExample: `<code>\"String literal\"</code>`\n\n**Booleans**. Enclose booleans in code tags (without quotes).\\\nExample: `<code>true</code>`\n\n**Enum Values**. See **Strings**.\n\n**Notes**. Use div tags for notes.\\\nExample: `<div class='note'>FYI</div>`\n\n**Internal Slots**. Use upper camel case (initial upper case letter) with a leading backslash and enclosed by two brackets. The leading backslash prevents the text in double brackets from being interpreted as a reference. If a slot name is very general, like \"Id\", it might be useful to add more information to it to avoid name collisions and make it easier to identify its owning entity. For example, \"Id\" could be extended to \"ComponentId\".\\\nExample (defining): `<dfn>[[\\FooBar]]</dfn>`\\\nExample (referencing): `<a>[[\\FooBar]]</a>`\n\n### Tests\nFor normative changes, a corresponding [web-platform-tests](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt) PR is highly appreciated. Typically, both PRs will be merged at the same time. Note that a test change that contradicts the spec should not be merged before the corresponding spec change. If testing is not practical, please explain why and if appropriate [file a web-platform-tests issue](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/issues/new) to follow up later. Add the `type:untestable` or `type:missing-coverage` label as appropriate.\n",

This is area-2 of the [credible web work](https://credweb.org).\n\nSee: https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/1969 for work on ClaimReview itself.\n\nThe suggested proposals in this area are:\n\n1. Allow professional fact-checks to be published in machine readable form so they can more easily be matched, used in automated assessments, and shown to users when appropriate. (Already being done using claimreview)\n2. Allow claim-extraction processes to publish their output for broad consumption. This would be a feed of claims found in the media and judged to be of relatively high value for checking. \n3. Allow users to express their desire for specific claims in some content to be checked. Might include offer to pay for results.\n4. Allow relationships between claims to be expressed, such as rephrasings to be more precise and context-free vs more terse and context-sensitive, more in agreement vs disagreement with the claim itself, making a broader vs narrower claim, between natural languages, and opposites.\n5. Allow structure of a fact-check to be exposed as machine-readable, showing argumentation and secure links to the evidence\n6. Allow end-users to express what they feel or know relevant to a claim’s accuracy, in a way that might be reasonable aggregated toward accurate credibility assessment. It's important this not be simply popularity polling; important ideas, when they start, are usually believed by exactly one person.\n7. Make it easy to view reviews of related claims from many sources at once, including some data about the sources, such as assessed bias\n\nSome relevant technologies:\n\n* Claim extraction: given some natural language text, recognize fragments that are likely to be checkable claims\n* Claim matching: given some claim text, find other claims which are likely to be highly relevant\n* Claim interpretation: given some natural language claim text, automatically perform relevant databases searches and calculations to check it\n\n"

(see [#2](https://github.com/w3c/translation-management/issues/2))\n* once these automated checks pass and at least one reviewer validates the translation, the translation is automatically published by W3C and linked from relevant W3C pages (see [#4](https://github.com/w3c/translation-management/issues/4))\n* the same repository where the translation document was brought via a pull request is used to maintain the translations as changes in the original document or mistakes in the translation get reported (see [#3](https://github.com/w3c/translation-management/issues/3))\n"

The format of the\nJSON files is still highly open to being changed. The data in the files is\nbeing provided here in the hope that it will prove useful to spec editors\nand others. If it does, then we’ll eventually settle on a stable format.\n\n### Adding data\n\nAll JSON files in the root directory here are generated files. So you don’t\nwant to edit them directly; instead you’d need to edit the upstream data at\nhttps://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data and\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web articles.\n\nThe files in the `.local` directory are static files, for handling cases\nwhere an MDN article has links to a particular spec but that MDN article\ndoesn’t have any corresponding data in BCD. The structure of each `.local`\nfile is similar a simplification of the structure of the JSON files in the\nroot directory — with the `summary` and `title` fields omitted, and with a\nstring for the value of the `support` field. Use that string to specify\na feature whose `support` data should be borrowed and used as the `support`\nvalue for the spec ID give in the `.local` file.\n\n"

      "contributing": "We're really happy to accept contributions to the mdn-browser-compat-data repository!\nThis file lists some general guidelines to help you contributing effectively.\n\n## Types of contribution\n\nThere are many ways you can help improve this repository! For example:\n\n* **Adding new compat data**: familiarize yourself with the [schema](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/blob/master/schemas/compat-data.schema.json) and read the [schema docs](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/blob/master/schemas/compat-data-schema.md) to add new files.\n* **Fixing existing compat data**: maybe a browser now supports a certain feature. Yay! If you open a PR to fix a browser's data, it would be most helpful if you include a link to a bug report or similar so that we can double-check the good news.\n* **Fixing a bug:** we have a list of [issues](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/issues),\nor maybe you found your own.\n* **Reviewing a pull request:** there is a list of [PRs](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/pulls).\nLet us know if these look good to you.\n* **Publishing a new package (staff only):** A new npm package should be published regularly, [see below](#publishing-a-new-package-version) for details.\n\n## Validating the data\nYou can use `npm test` to validate data against the schema. You might need to install the devDependencies using `npm install`.\nThe JSON data is validated against the schema using [`ajv`](http://epoberezkin.github.io/ajv/).\n\n## Generating data using the Web API Confluence Dashboard\nIf the feature you're interested in is a JavaScript API, you can cross-reference data against [Web API Confluence](https://web-confluence.appspot.com/) using the `confluence` command. This command overwrites data in your current working tree according to data from the dashboard. See [Using Confluence](USING-CONFLUENCE.md) for instructions.\n\n## Test rendering\nYou can use `npm run render $query $dept $aggregateMode` to output the table HTML as it would be rendered on MDN.\nThe parameters are the same as the [`{{compat}}` macro](https://github.com/mdn/kumascript/blob/master/macros/Compat.ejs).\n\nPaste the generated HTML into the MDN editor (source mode). You can use a new page, for example: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/new and verify if the output looks correct.\n\n## Checklist\nNot everything is enforced or validated by the schema. A few things to pay attention to:\n\n* Feature identifiers (the data namespaces, like `css.properties.background`) should make sense and are spelled correctly.\n* Nesting of feature identifiers should make sense.\n* Notes use correct grammar and spelling. They should be complete sentences ending with a period.\n\n## Code style\n\nThe JSON files should be formatted according to the [.editorconfig](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/blob/master/.editorconfig) file.\n\n\n## Publishing a new package version\n\nRegularly, a new release of [mdn-browser-compat-data](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mdn-browser-compat-data) is created by MDN staff and will then be [deployed to the MDN site](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data#browser-compatibility-tables-on-mdn). Usually this is done every Thursday (MDN never deploys to production on Fridays). Releases should be coordinated with the project owner [Florian Scholz](https://github.com/Elchi3), but anyone with merge permissions on the mdn/browser-compat-data repository has the ability to run the following steps which will create a new package version:\n\n 1. Figure out the new version number by looking at [past releases](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/releases). The project is in alpha, so we're using only patch versions. Lets assume the next version should be `0.0.43`.\n 2. On your updated and clean master branch, run `npm version patch -m \"43rd alpha version\"`. Locally, this updates `package.json`, creates a new commit, and creates a new release tag (see also the docs for [npm version](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/version)).\n 3. Push the commit to master: `git push origin master`.\n 4. Check if the commit passes fine on [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/mdn/browser-compat-data).\n 5. If Travis is alright, push the git tag as well: `git push origin v0.0.43`.\n This step will trigger Travis to publish to npm automatically (see our [.travis.yml file](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/blob/master/.travis.yml)).\n 6. Check [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/mdn/browser-compat-data) again for the v0.0.43 build and also check [mdn-browser-compat-data on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mdn-browser-compat-data) to see if `0.0.43` shows up correctly once Travis has finished its work.\n 7. Notify the [#mdndev](irc://irc.mozilla.org/mdndev) IRC channel on irc.mozilla.org about the new release and coordinate with jwhitlock or rjohnson a deployment of the new package to the MDN site.\n 8. Create a new [release on GitHub](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/releases) by running `npm run release-notes -- v0.0.43`).\n\n## Licensing\n\nPlease note that the compatibility data is made available under the\n[CC0 license](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/blob/master/LICENSE),\nso any contributions must be compatible with that license. If you're not sure about that, just ask.\n\n## Getting help\n\nIf you need help with this repository or have any questions, contact the MDN team\nin the [#mdn](irc://irc.mozilla.org/mdn) IRC channel on irc.mozilla.org or write us on [discourse](https://discourse.mozilla-community.org/c/mdn).\n",

      "contributing": "# Governance and Contribution to the Distributed Tracing working group\n\nThis document describes the contribution and governance rules for the [W3C Distributed Tracing Working Group](https://www.w3.org/2018/distributed-tracing/). This includes the following specifications\n\n- [Trace Context](https://github.com/w3c/trace-context)\n- [Correlation Context](https://github.com/w3c/correlation-context)\n\n## Interacting with the working group\n\nThe working group encourages all forms of contribution and questions. If you have a question, please open an issue on Github in the specification repository. \n\n## Collaboration under the W3C Process Model\n\nAs the working group is an W3C working group it operates under the [W3C Process Model](https://www.w3.org/2018/Process-20180201/). All further contribution guidelines only extend the W3C process model. If this document and the process model contradict each other, the W3C process model takes precedence.\n\n\n## Meetings\n\nMeetings follow the [W3C Process Model Guidelines for Meetings](https://www.w3.org/2018/Process-20180201/#GeneralMeetings). This section defines additional meeting guidelines extending these guidelines:\n\n- Official conference calls are held on a bi-weekly basis and are announced on a [shared calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=dynatrace.com_5a09qhua6fh7jb23h7vdjg6veg%40group.calendar.google.com)\n- Face-to-face topic-based work meetings will be announced at least 4 weeks in advance. Ideally, they are announce 8 weeks in advance as defined in the W3C process model. \n- Proposed changes to any document MUST be handled via a Pull Request (PR). If the change came up during a meeting the meeting owner is responsible for creating the PR.\n- PRs will be reviewed during official meetings, but off-line reviews (LGTMs, NOT LGTMs) and comments are strongly encouraged to gauge the group's opinion on the proposed change prior to the meeting.\n- If a topic is not defined specifically enough yet to justify a PR against the specification, contributors are encouraged to file an issue. \n- During meetings, priority will be given to PRs that appear to be ready for a vote over those that appear to require discussions.\n- Rebases, typo fixes, etc. do not count as substantial. Note, administrative PRs that do not materially modify output documents may be processed by admins as needed.\n- PR's can be marked for resolution during a meeting and will be merged when all issues have been addressed and the PR was open for comments for at least one business week. \n- If issues arise after a PR has been merged, the preferred approach is to file a new issue. In rare cases the group can decide to revert a PR.\n\n## Participation  \n\nThere are three categories of project participation:\n\n1. Non Working Group Member. This is anyone who  participates in the group's activities in any of our communication channels (email, github issues/PRs, meetings, etc.). In contrast to Working Group members they can file a PR but not vote on a PR. They can, however, create issues for specifications. \n2. Working Group Member. This is anyone who officially participates in the group's activities in any of our communication channels (email, github issues/PRs, meetings, etc.). Working group members can file PRs against documents and can participate in the PR voting procedure. Working Group members need to be employed by a W3C member organization or participate as invited experts. The [W3C process document](https://www.w3.org/2018/Process-20180201/#MemberBenefits) defines the rights of members. \n3. Chairs and Co-Chairs are members of the group but have the ability to perform administrative actions on behalf of the group. For example, manage the website, github repos and moderate the meetings. Their actions should be done with the knowledge and consent of the group. They also have the ability to merge/close PRs, but only per the group's approval. \n\n## PRs and Voting\n\nSpecificaiton changes are proposed via PRs which are expected to meet the following criteria prior to being merged:\n\n- The author of the PR indicates that it is ready setting a \"ready to review\" tag for review by asking for it to be discussed in an upcoming meeting - eg. by adding it to the agenda document.\n- All comments have been addressed.\n- PRs that have objections/concerns will be discussed in dedicated by interested parties. A resolution, updated PR, will be expected from those talks.\n\nEvery member of the working group is encouraged to vote with a statement of support and dissent on any PR. If a member has concerns regarding a PR they are encouraged to comment on the issue and join in discussions. If a member does reply to a comment within a reasonable timeframe - one business week - the comment is considered properly addressed. \n\nThe goal of the working group is to reach consensus by discussion. If consensus cannot be reached the [W3C Voting rules](https://www.w3.org/2018/Process-20180201/#Votes) apply. \n",

Please make sure to read rationale documents when you have a question about particular\ndecision made in specification.\n\n## Goal\n\nThis specification defines formats to pass trace context information across systems. Our goal is\nto share this with the community so that various tracing and diagnostics products can operate\ntogether.\n\n- If this becomes popular, frameworks and other services will automatically pass\n  trace IDs through for correlated requests. This would prevent traces from\n  hitting dead ends when a request reaches an un-instrumented service.\n- Once aligned on a header name, we can ask for a CORS exception from the W3C.\n  This would allow browsers to attach trace IDs to requests and submit tracing\n  data to a distributed tracing service.\n- Loggers can reliably parse trace / span IDs and include them in logs for\n  correlation purposes.\n- Customers can use multiple tracing solutions (Zipkin + New Relic) at the same\n  time and not have to worry about propagating two sets of context headers.\n- Frameworks can *bless* access to the trace context even if they prevent access\n  to underlying request headers, making it available by default.\n\n## Contributing\n\nSee [Contributing.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.\n\n- [Group participants](https://www.w3.org/2000/09/dbwg/details?group=108594&order=org&public=1)\n- [How to join](https://www.w3.org/2004/01/pp-impl/108594/join)\n- [Royalty-Free Patent Policy](https://www.w3.org/2004/01/pp-impl/108594/status)\n",

The Purpose and General Terms of this Contributor License Agreement (CLA). This CLA sets forth the terms under which I will participate in and contribute to the development of the Specification, if any, created by the Project. Any other capitalized terms not specifically defined herein have the same meaning as those terms have in the [W3C Patent Policy](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent/), and if not defined there, in the [W3C Process Document](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/). Any source code created by the Project is not subject to this CLA, but rather subject to separate licensing terms for that source code. The W3C [Community and Business Group Process](https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/) governs the operations of the Project. The Community and Business Group Process delegates some rights to the participants of the Project to establish operational agreements. Those operational agreements must not conflict with or modify this Community and Business Group Process, the [Community Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/cla), or the [Final Specification Agreement](https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/final). Except for the limited definitions specifically referenced herein, this CLA and the Final Specification Agreement, if I sign it, set forth my entire licensing obligations for Specifications created by the Project and supersede all prior negotiations, agreements, understandings, and obligations with respect thereto.\n2.  2\\. Copyrights.\n    1.  2.1. Copyright Grant. I grant to you a perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright), worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, copyright license, without any obligation for accounting to me, to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, distribute, and implement any Contribution to the full extent of my copyright interest in the Contribution.\n    2.  2.2. Attribution. As a condition of the copyright grant, you must include an attribution to the Specification in any derivative work you make based on the Specification. That attribution must include, at minimum, the Specification name and version number.\n3.  3\\. Patents.\n    1.  3.1. Patent Licensing Commitment. I agree to license my Essential Claims under the W3C CLA RF Licensing Requirements. This requirement includes Essential Claims that I own and any that I have the right to license without obligation of payment or other consideration to an unrelated third party. With the exception of the provisions of Section 5 below, W3C CLA RF Licensing Requirements obligations made concerning the Specification and described in this CLA are binding on me for the life of the patents in question and encumber the patents containing Essential Claims, regardless of changes in participation status or W3C Membership. I also agree to license my Essential Claims under the W3C CLA RF Licensing Requirements in derivative works of the Specification developed by the Project, provided that my Contribution remains intact in those derivative works. However, no additional claims are made Essential Claims in the combination of my Contribution with derivative works of the Specification.\n    2.  3.2. Optional, Additional Patent Grant. In addition to the provisions of Section 3.1, I may also, at my option, make certain intellectual property rights infringed by implementations of the Specification, including Essential Claims, available by providing those terms via the W3C Web site.\n4.  4\\. No Other Rights. Except as specifically set forth in this CLA, no other express or implied patent, trademark, copyright, or other property rights are granted under this CLA, including by implication, waiver, or estoppel.\n5.  5\\. Limited Opt-Out. I, in my sole discretion, may withdraw my Contribution, for any reason, by providing written notice of that withdrawal no later than 45 days after the date of my Contribution. Notice of withdrawal of a Contribution must be made in writing using the Project's communications mechanisms for that purpose and must describe the exact material of the particular Contribution being withdrawn. Upon providing that notice, the identified Contribution will be deemed null and void, and, not withstanding anything to the contrary herein, I will not be deemed to have incurred any obligation with respect to that Contribution. In addition, any particular Contribution will be null and void, and I will not incur any obligation as a result of it, if that Contribution is not included in the Specification within 150 days of the date of that Contribution.\n6.  6\\. W3C Community Contributor License Agreement Execution. I acknowledge that the goal of this CLA is to provide coverage for Contributions to the Specification, if any, created by the Project. The Final Specification itself, if any, will be subject to the [W3C Community Final Specification Agreement](https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/final). While I have no legal obligation to execute the W3C Community Final Specification Agreement for any version of the Specification being developed under this CLA, I agree that the selection and terms of the then current W3C Community Final Specification Agreement will not be subject to negotiation.\n7.  7\\. Antitrust Compliance. I acknowledge that I may compete with other participants, that I am under no obligation to implement the Specification, that each participant is free to develop competing technologies and standards, and that each party is free to license its patent rights to third parties, including for the purpose of enabling competing technologies and standards.\n8.  8\\. Non-Circumvention. I agree that I will not intentionally take or willfully assist any third party to take any action for the purpose of circumventing my obligations under this CLA.\n9.  9\\. Transition to W3C Recommendation Track. Specifications developed by the Project may transition to the W3C Recommendation Track. The W3C Team is responsible for notifying me that a Corresponding Working Group has been chartered. I have no obligation to join the Corresponding Working Group. If the Specification developed under the Project transitions to the W3C Recommendation Track, the following terms apply:\n    1.  9.1. If I join the Corresponding Working Group. If I join the Corresponding Working Group, I will be subject to all W3C rules, obligations, licensing commitments, and policies that govern that Corresponding Working Group.\n    2.  9.2. If I Do Not Join the Corresponding Working Group.\n        1.  9.2.1. Licensing Obligations to Resulting Specification. If I do not join the Corresponding Working Group, I agree to offer patent licenses according to the W3C Royalty-Free licensing requirements described in Section 5 of the W3C Patent Policy for my Contributions included in the resulting Recommendation. This licensing commitment may not be revoked but may be modified through the exclusion process defined in Section 4 of the W3C Patent Policy. I am not required to join a Working Group to exclude patents from the W3C Royalty-Free licensing commitment, but must otherwise follow the normal exclusion procedures defined by the W3C Patent Policy. The W3C Team will notify me of any Call for Exclusion in the Corresponding Working Group as set forth in Section 4.5 of the W3C Patent Policy.\n        2.  9.2.2. No Disclosure Obligation. If I do not join the Corresponding Working Group, I have no patent disclosure obligations outside of those set forth in Section 6 of the W3C Patent Policy.\n10. 10\\. Conflict of Interest. I will disclose significant relationships when those relationships might reasonably be perceived as creating a conflict of interest with my role. I will notify W3C of any change in my affiliation using W3C-provided mechanisms.\n11. 11\\. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimers. I represent and warrant that 1) I am legally entitled to grant the rights and promises set forth in this CLA and 2) I will not intentionally include any third party materials in any Contribution unless those materials are available under terms that do not conflict with this CLA and I identify any such third party materials. IN ALL OTHER RESPECTS MY CONTRIBUTIONS ARE PROVIDED \"AS IS.\" The entire risk as to implementing or otherwise using the Contribution or the Specification is assumed by the implementer and user. Except as stated herein, I expressly disclaim any warranties (express, implied, or otherwise), including implied warranties of merchantability, non-infringement, fitness for a particular purpose, or title, related to the Contribution or the Specification. IN NO EVENT WILL ANY PARTY BE LIABLE TO ANY OTHER PARTY FOR LOST PROFITS OR ANY FORM OF INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER FROM ANY CAUSES OF ACTION OF ANY KIND WITH RESPECT TO THIS CLA, WHETHER BASED ON BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR NOT THE OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.\n12. 12\\. Definitions.\n    1.  12.1. CLA. \"CLA\" means this Contributor Licensing Agreement.\n    2.  12.2. Contribution. \"Contribution\" means any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that I intentionally submit for inclusion in the Specification, and which Contribution is actually included in the Specification. For the purposes of this definition, the method by which I \"submit\" a Contribution means any form of electronic, oral, or written communication for the purpose of discussing and improving the Specification, but excludes any such communication that I conspicuously designate in writing as not a Contribution to one or more of the Specifications developed by the Project.\n    3.  12.3. Corresponding Working Group. \"Corresponding Working Group\" is a W3C Working Group that is chartered to develop a Recommendation that takes the Specification as an input.\n    4.  12.4. Essential Claims. \"Essential Claims\" shall mean all claims in any patent or patent application in any jurisdiction in the world that would necessarily be infringed by implementation of my Contributions in an implementation of the Specification. A claim is necessarily infringed hereunder only when it is not possible to avoid infringing it because there is no non-infringing alternative for implementing the normative portions of the Specification. Existence of a non-infringing alternative shall be judged based on the state of the art at the time my Contribution is included in the Specification. The following are expressly excluded from and shall not be deemed to constitute Essential Claims:\n        1.  12.4.1. any claims other than as set forth above even if contained in the same patent as Essential Claims; and\n        2.  12.4.2. claims which would be infringed only by:\n            -   portions of an implementation that are not specified in the normative portions of the Specification, or\n            -   enabling technologies that may be necessary to make or use any product or portion thereof that complies with the Specification and are not themselves expressly set forth in the Specification (e.g., semiconductor manufacturing technology, compiler technology, object-oriented technology, basic operating system technology, and the like); or\n            -   the implementation of technology developed elsewhere and merely incorporated by reference in the body of the Specification.\n        3.  12.4.3. design patents and design registrations.\n\n        For purposes of this definition, the normative portions of the Specification shall be deemed to include only architectural and interoperability requirements. Optional features in the RFC 2119 sense are considered normative unless they are specifically identified as informative. Implementation examples or any other material that merely illustrate the requirements of the Specification are informative, rather than normative.\n\n    5.  12.5. I, Me, or My. \"I,\" \"me,\" or \"my\" refers to the signatory.\n    6.  12.6. Project. \"Project\" means the W3C Community Group or Business Group for which I executed this CLA.\n    7.  12.7.

      "readme": "# Auto-WCAG Rules repository\n\nThe Auto-WCAG Rules repository is where the Auto-WCAG community group maintains the rules they designed for (semi-)automated accessibility testing. Within the rules directory you will find all the rules recommended by the Auto-WCAG community group for implementation in automated test tools.\n\nVisit the [Auto-WCAG Rules website](https://auto-wcag.github.io/auto-wcag/) for the latest rules and drafts.\n\n## Related W3C Activities\n\nThe Auto-WCAG Community Group is the primary contributor of rules to the Accessibility Conformance Testing (ACT) Taskforce for the W3C. The ACT Taskforce is currently developing the standard around which rules can be created, and is planning to put together a suite of rules on how WCAG 2 (and beyond) should be tested.\n\nFor more information, see [ACT Overview - What is ACT](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/task-forces/conformance-testing/wiki/ACT_Overview_-_What_is_ACT).\n\n## Write rules, not tools\n\nAn Auto-WCAG rule is a step by step description of how an accessibility test tool should run a certain conformance test for the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines][WCAG20]. The rules are written without a specific implementation in mind. The goal is not to create an accessibility test tool. Instead we aim to harmonize between existing tools, and improve their transparency and the overall quality of their results.\n\nIf you want to know more about us, visit our website at: [www.w3.org/community/auto-wcag][Auto-WCAG].\n\n## Implementing Auto-WCAG Rules\n\nAnyone developing their own accessibility testing tool is free to based this on the Auto-WCAG rules. We encourage you to document any deviations from those rules if you do so, and make these changes known to your users. Also take note that the Auto-WCAG Rules come with an aggregation algorithm describing how they all fits together, and require the tool to do some pre and post processing. All of which is described in the [test methodology](https://auto-wcag.github.io/auto-wcag/pages/design/rule-design.html).\n\n## Contribute\n\nContributing is open to anyone. We welcome any pull requests for changes. We ask that you make changes to pull requests **only for drafts**. Before contributing new rules, we recommend you checked their validity with several experienced accessibility auditors first. This helps you identify potential stumbling blocks early in their design.\n\nAuto-WCAG has conference calls every 4 weeks. If you are interested in becoming an active contributor or reviewer, we ask that you join the Auto-WCAG community group through the W3C Website. This requires setting up a W3C account, may require approval by the organization you work for if they are a W3C member.\n\n**[Join the Auto-WcAG community group now!](https://www.w3.org/community/wp-login.php?redirect_to=%2Fcommunity%2Fauto-wcag%2Fjoin)** or visit [w3.org/community/auto-wcag/][Auto-WCAG] for more information.\n\n\n[WCAG20]: https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/\n[Auto-WCAG]: https://www.w3.org/community/auto-wcag/\n"

      "readme": "# EasierRDF\n\n_This repository is for experimental/exploratory work on making RDF easier to use, with the goal of making it easy enough for *average* developers (middle 33% of ability).  By \"RDF\" we mean the whole RDF ecosystem -- including SPARQL, OWL, tools, standards, educational materials, etc. -- everything that a developer touches when using RDF.  Our plan:_\n* _focus and coordinate community efforts;_\n* _build on existing standards whenever possible;_\n* _launch additional W3C Community Groups to tackle specific areas of need, including_\n  * _[n3-dev Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/n3-dev/), for standardizing N3 rules; and_\n* _contribute to (and benefit from) related efforts, such as the [W3C Graph Data Workshop](https://www.w3.org/Data/events/data-ws-2019/cfp.html) in March 2019, which prepare the path for launching new standards work at W3C._\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe value of RDF for graph data has been well proven, in many applications, over the 20+ years since it was first created.  However, difficulty of use has caused RDF to be categorized as a niche technology. This is unfortunate because it limits uptake and prevents RDF from being viewed as a viable choice for many use cases that would otherwise be an excellent fit.\n\nThis work seeks to build upon our experience with RDF to examine how we can make it easier to use.  What aspects or gaps have caused difficulty?    How can RDF better support features that users commonly need and other graph databases offer?  How can we make RDF -- or a successor -- easy enough for *average* developers?\n\nAt the same time, businesses are now showing a rapidly growing interest in graph data.  Businesses have used relational databases for many years, but it is costly to adapt database schema and applications in response to evolving application needs.  Other graph and NoSQL databases have emerged to help meet this need.  Unfortunately, there is a lack of interoperability across existing graph data solutions, motivating [interest in open standards for an interchange framework](https://www.w3.org/Data/events/data-ws-2019/cfp.html).  RDF is an appealing vendor neutral framework for graph data, and is well positioned to take on the role of an interchange framework.  Although this interest in RDF as a graph interchange framework arose independently from the effort to make RDF easier, and has different goals, there is a natural overlap in motivation, and both efforts can benefit each other.\n\n## Guiding principles\n\n**1. The goal is to make RDF -- or some RDF-based successor -- easy enough for *average* developers (middle 33%), who are new to RDF, to be consistently successful.**\n\n**2. Solutions may involve anything in the RDF ecosystem: standards, tools, guidance, etc.  All options are on the table.**\n\n**3. Backward compatibility is highly desirable, but *less* important than ease of use.**\n\n## How to contribute?\n\nWe welcome contributions. A good place to start is to review the [issues list](https://github.com/w3c/EasierRDF/issues), categorized below. Please feel free to start a new issue if none of the existing ones are a good match. We also welcome longer position papers and analyses, preferably in the GitHub markdown format.

Spatial data relates to spatial descriptions, e.g. rooms in buildings, streets in a city, electoral wards in a region. Time series and spatial data are often found together, e.g. traffic density across transport networks, and journey data for cars, buses and trains. Whilst it is common practice to develop isolated solutions, this increases the cost and risk involved when there is a need to develop applications that combine information from multiple sources in heterogeneous silos. Open standards have the potential to dramatically boost efficiency across many sectors.\n\nThis repository is aimed at gathering information on the challenges and opportunities for the use of time series and spatial data in preparation for a W3C Workshop as a first step towards developing new standards.\n"

Put your layouts in `_layouts`, your includes in `_includes`, your sass files in `_sass` and any other assets in `assets`.\n\nTo experiment with this code, add some sample content and run `bundle exec jekyll serve` – this directory is setup just like a Jekyll site!\n\nTODO: Delete this and the text above, and describe your gem\n\n\n## Installation\n\nAdd this line to your Jekyll site's `Gemfile`:\n\n```ruby\ngem \"wai-website-theme\"\n```\n\nAnd add this line to your Jekyll site's `_config.yml`:\n\n```yaml\ntheme: wai-website-theme\n```\n\nAnd then execute:\n\n    $ bundle\n\nOr install it yourself as:\n\n    $ gem install wai-website-theme\n\n## Usage\n\nTODO: Write usage instructions here. Describe your available layouts, includes, sass and/or assets.\n\n## Contributing\n\nBug reports and pull requests are welcome on GitHub at https://github.com/[USERNAME]/hello. This project is intended to be a safe, welcoming space for collaboration, and contributors are expected to adhere to the [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org) code of conduct.\n\n## Development\n\nTo set up your environment to develop this theme, run `bundle install`.\n\nYour theme is setup just like a normal Jekyll site! To test your theme, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and open your browser at `http://localhost:4000`. This starts a Jekyll server using your theme. Add pages, documents, data, etc. like normal to test your theme's contents. As you make modifications to your theme and to your content, your site will regenerate and you should see the changes in the browser after a refresh, just like normal.\n\nWhen your theme is released, only the files in `_layouts`, `_includes`, `_sass` and `assets` tracked with Git will be bundled.\nTo add a custom directory to your theme-gem, please edit the regexp in `wai-website-theme.gemspec` accordingly.\n\n## License\n\nThe theme is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).\n\n"

      "readme": "# TTML3 Test Suites\n\nThe TTML3 Test Suites consist of a validation test suite and a presentation test suite. The purpose of these test suites is to demonstrate adequate implementation experience of each (designated) feature of the [TTML3 Specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/TTML3/) as documented by the [TTML3 Implementation Report](https://www.w3.org/wiki/TimedText/TTML3ImplementationReport). An ancillary purpose is to promote ineroperability between implementations.\n\nThe tests found in these test suites focus on functionality and constraints thereof that derive directly from normative text in the [TTML3 Specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/TTML3/). Additional tests that go beyond the normative specification text are included here as well; however, though such tests are useful for wider interoperability testing, the results from their exercise are not reported in the [TTML3 Implementation Report](https://www.w3.org/wiki/TimedText/TTML3ImplementationReport). See also [Excluded Tests](#excluded-tests).\n\n## Validation Test Suite\n\nThe validation test suite is found under the `validation` directory, and is divided into two parts: (1) tests for valid content (validity tests) and (2) tests for invalid content (invalidity tests). The result of each test can be characterized as PASS or FAIL.\n\nA PASS result for a validity test occurs if the validator does not reject (report a validation error for) the content of the test. In contrast, a FAIL result for a validity test occurs if the validator rejects (reports a validation error for) the content of the test, in which case, such a result is deemed a _false negative_ result.\n\nA PASS result for an invalidity test occcurs if the validator rejects (reports a validation error for) the content of the test. In contrast, a FAIL result for an invalidity test occurs if the validator does not reject (report a validation error for) the content of the test, in which case, such a result is deemed a _false positive_ result.\n\nA validator is considered to **_strictly pass_** the test suite if it does not report a false negative for any validity test. A validator is considered to **_fully pass_** the test suite if it (1) strictly passes the test suite and (2) does not report a false positive for any invalidity test.\n\nFor the purpose of reporting an implementation of the validation function for a specific (designated) feature, the implementation must strictly pass all tests for that feature; however, it is not required to fully pass all tests for that feature since the TTML3 specification does not require a validator to detect all possibile invalidities, about which see [validate document](https://www.w3.org/TR/TTML3/#semantics-procedure-validate-document).\n\nA mapping from (designated) features to specific tests is found in `validation/tests.json`, which, for each new TTML3 feature designator, lists validity and invalidity tests (by name), and optionally includes a per-test exclusion flag if the test is intended to be excluded from exit criteria consideration. We refer to this mapping file as the *validation test manifest*.\n\n## Presentation Test Suite\n\nThe presentation test suite is found under the `presentation` directory, and is divided into two parts: (1) tests for presenting valid content and (2) tests for presenting invalid content.\n\nA mapping from (designated) features to specific tests is found in `presentation/tests.json`, which, for each new TTML3 feature designator, lists presentation tests (by name), and optionally includes a per-test exclusion flag if the test is intended to be excluded from exit criteria consideration. We refer to this mapping file as the *presentation test manifest*.\n\nFor tests having primarily visual presentation semantics, each presentation test is associated with a like named ZIP archive with the suffix `.expected.zip`, which contains the output of a particular reference implementation (TTPE). Each such _reference archive_ contains a manifest file and one or more image frames represented in some image format. In the present form of the reference archives, the image format is `image/svg+xml`. These image frames should **not** be construed as normative, but merely serve as a possible reference image for performing (human visual) comparisons of expected output.\n\n## Excluded Tests\n\nAs noted above, the two (validation and presentation) test manifests employ an *exclusion* flag to denote that a test is excluded from exit criteria consideration. The tests marked as excluded (presently) consist of tests that may be useful for testing implementations, but are not necessarily derived from normative specification language, as well as tests for which there is some question as to whether they correctly represent normative specification requirements. In both cases, these tests may, but need not be exercised by implementations, and there is no expectation that the results from such tests will be reported by implementors.\n\n## Pending Tests\n\nTests located in the `pending` directory are under consideration for future addition to the test suite. They are not considered part of the formal test suite at this time; furthermore, there is no (fixed) schedule for their addition (or not) to the test suite.\n\n## Test Annotation Attributes\n\nIn addition to standard, TTML3 defined attributes, each test contains certain tool-specific annotation attributes in a namespace associated with the `ttva` prefix. These attributes are used by a certain reference implementation, [TTV](https://github.com/skynav/ttt/tree/master/ttt-ttv), to facilitate the testing process. Note that TTML3 content processing requires processors to prune (ignore) unrecognized namespace qualified attributes. See [Annotations](https://github.com/skynav/ttt/tree/master/ttt-ttv#annotations) for further information on their usage.\n",

This reel was created with the same scope as the original reel, where the items that are tested are all pertinent to subtitles produced for production content. This version adds numerous additional tests that focus on foreign language rendering, color compositing to different color spaces, and some new IMSC 1.1 attributes. Like the original reel, this has been built to help manufacturers with their IMSC 1.1 Text implementations by providing them with a reference IMSC package.\n\nThis test content includes the following assets:\n- IMSC1-1_TEXT_Test-Reel_FMS_v3-0_2019-01-29.xml\n- IMSC1-1_TEXT_Test-Reel_FMS_v3-0_2019-01-29_Rec709_Backplate.mov*\n- IMSC1-1_TEXT_Test-Reel_FMS_v3-0_2019-01-29_Rec709_CompositedProxy.mp4*\n- IMSC1-1_TEXT_Test-Reel_FMS_v3-0_2019-01-29_Rec2020-PQ_Backplate.mov*\n- IMSC1-1_TEXT_Test-Reel_FMS_v3-0_2019-01-29_Rec2020-PQ_CompositedProxy.mp4*\n\n    **Please note that these media files are hosted at https://media.w3.org/, and are linked to via .URL  internet shortcut files.*\n\nThe IMSC XML file is to be rendered over the Backplate ProRes HQ file. If the IMSC decoding is accurate, it will look approximately the same as the Composited Proxy file. It is acceptable for there to be slight differences in text rendering, since the proportionalSansSerif font chosen by the renderer may be different than what was used for the proxy. There is both a Rec 709 backplate and proxy, along with a Rec 2020 PQ backplate and proxy. The recommended approach for compositing sRGB subtitles to rec 709 and rec 2020 PQ is:\n\n    sRGB (EOTF 2.4) to 709 Full Range (EOTF 2.4)\n    No conversion is required.\n\n    sRGB (EOTF 2.4) to 709 Narrow Range (EOTF 2.4)\n    Scale the sRGB values to narrow range as described in section 6 of RP 2077:2013.\n\n    sRGB (EOTF 2.4) to PQ 2020 Full Range (EOTF PQ)\n    Map the sRGB values to PQ 2020 Full Range as described in section Q.1 of the TTML2 Recommendation.\n\n    sRGB (EOTF 2.4) to PQ 2020 Narrow Range (EOTF PQ)\n    Map the sRGB values to PQ 2020 Full Range as described in section Q.1 of the TTML2 Recommendation,\n    then scale those values to narrow range as described in section 6 of RP 2077:2013.\n\nThe IMSC 1.1 XML file includes in-line comments which describes the purpose of each test.\n\nThe backplate includes the following:\n- Frame counter and Media Time counter\n- Grid with lines every 5%\n- Yellow crosses at each corner of the region\n- Sync counter at the beginning and end of each event\n",

It allows the standards development organization to maintain vendor neutral control over a specification, and thus protect the consensus found within a Working Group.\n\nIn the course of the development of materials within the W3C, Task Force Participants will make contributions. Those contributions will be integrated into the jointly developed work thus creating shared copyright on the Task Force Participant's contribution. Most W3C Specifications contain a section with acknowledgement of contributions.\n\nTask Force Participants grant to the W3C a perpetual, nonexclusive, royalty-free, world-wide right and license under any Task Force Participant's copyrights on his or her contributions, to copy, publish and distribute the contribution under a license of W3C's choosing. Additionally, the Task Force Participant grants a right and license of the same scope to any derivative works prepared by the W3C and based on, or incorporating all or part of, his or her contribution and that any derivative works of this contribution prepared by the W3C shall be solely owned by the W3C. Furthermore, the Task Force Participant understands that W3C will be able to exercise all rights as a copyright owner of Task Force Participant's contribution, including enforcement against infringers without additional agreement or notice.\n\nNothing in this agreement restricts the Task Force Participant from using their individual contributions as they wish, even if those have later been amalgamated into joint works. Where W3C releases materials under a permissive license such as the W3C Software License or CC-BY, nothing in this agreement should be read to restrict the Task Force Participant from exercising the permissions granted by that license. The Task Force Participant represents that they are legally entitled to grant the above license. If their employer(s) have rights to intellectual property that the Task Force Participant creates that includes the contributions, they represent that they have received permission to make contributions on behalf of that employer or that the employer has waived such rights for the contributions to W3C.\n\n\n## Decency\n\nThe Task Force Participant will participate in the W3C Group in a decent way. Task Force Participants will refrain from defaming, harassing or otherwise offending other participants. The [Section 3.1 of the Process Document](https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#ParticipationCriteria) applies, as does the W3C [Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/).\n\nThe Task Force Participant will refrain from sending unsolicited commercial messages to W3C mailing-lists and other promotional activities for personal matters or for third parties. This is especially required from Task Force Participants sending messages to public W3C Groups.\n",
      "readme": "# European Language Enablement\n\nThis repository exists to allow a network of experts to share information about gaps and requirements for support of European-origin scripts and languages on the Web and in eBooks. \n\nThe main problem we seem to face at the moment is that experts don't know how to tell the W3C what problems exist for support of their script on the Web, and the W3C doesn't know how to contact people who can help when questions arise. This network of experts should help to significantly reduce that problem. \n\nSome experts may go a step further, and contribute to a gap-analysis or requirements document for a given script.\n\nTopics for discussion are suggested by [the gap-analysis template](http://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/templates/gap-analysis/gap-analysis_template.html). This work supports the development of the [matrix](http://w3c.github.io/typography/gap-analysis/language-matrix.html) indicating hot-spots for language support.\n\n### Documents\n- [Dutch gap analysis](https://w3c.github.io/eurlreq/gap-analysis/latn-nl-gap)\n- [Georgian gap analysis](https://w3c.github.io/eurlreq/gap-analysis/geor-gap)\n- [Greek gap analysis](https://w3c.github.io/eurlreq/gap-analysis/grek-gap)\n- [Hungarian gap analysis](https://w3c.github.io/eurlreq/gap-analysis/latn-hu-gap)\n\n\n### Feedback\nPlease use the [GitHub issue list](https://github.com/w3c/eurlreq/issues) to report issues for language support, for discussions, and to send feedback about documents.\n\n### Following\nRather than just 'Watch' this repository, it is best to subscribe to the [public-i18n-sea](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-i18n-eur/) mailing list. That list is notified once a day (in digest form) about not only changes to this repository, but also about other W3C Working Group issues related to Southeast Asian writing systems. (Please use github issues rather than the mailing list to send feedback.)\n\nYou can find a list of open issues, including those from Working Groups, on the [Layout Tracker](http://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/textlayout/?filter=europe) page. (That link applies a europe filter.)\n\n### Contributing\nAll contributors should read and agree with [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nGroup _members_ are expert contributors who provide advice on requirements and gaps for the script they are familiar with. Some may also participate actively in producing the work of the group, contributing text and advice to create the outputs, and participating in meetings. For more information about becoming a group member contact [Richard Ishida](mailto:ishida@w3.org).

The included tests are all pertinent to subtitles produced for production content.\n\nThis test content includes the following assets:\n\n- IMSC1-0-1_TEXT_Test-Reel_FMS_v2-1_2018-01-23.xml\n- IMSC1-0-1_TEXT_Test-Reel_FMS_v2-1_2018-01-23_Backplate.mov*\n- IMSC1-0-1_TEXT_Test-Reel_FMS_v2-1_2018-01-23_CompositedProxy.mov*\n\n  **Please note that these media files are hosted at https://media.w3.org/, and are linked to via .URL internet shortcut files.*\n\nThe IMSC XML file is to be rendered over the Backplate ProRes HQ file. If the IMSC decoding is accurate, it will look approximately the same as the Composited Proxy file. It is acceptable for there to be slight differences in text rendering, since the proportionalSansSerif font chosen by the renderer may be different than what was used for the proxy.\n\nThe backplate includes the following:\n- Frame counter and Media Time counter\n- Grid with lines every 5%\n- Yellow crosses at each corner of the region\n- Red arrows which show the X and Y text flow direction\n- Sync counter at the beginning and end of each event\n",
